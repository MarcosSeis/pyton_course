The Company forecasts initial capital costs to be $332 million (see table below). The mining cost increase of approximately $16 million is related to the extended project schedule as well as increased waste rock disposal costs, including hauling, placement at the temporary waste dump and construction of the permanent waste rock dump. Mineral process plant costs, which includes the lower platform and tailing facility construction, are estimated to be approximately $13 million over budget. These costs include additional work for expediting structural steel fabrication, blasting required for lower platform excavation, offsite materials purchased for tailing facility construction, extra work required for supporting the cut above the lower platform elevation and contractor indirect costs. The $2.2 million increase for site infrastructure is related to the additional scope for constructing the mill shop, warehouse and assay/met lab and temporary power generation. Total project indirect costs increased by $29 million, offset with the $8.7 million contingency. Owner costs increased due to additional engineering, construction management, enlarging the camp capacity and adding several administrative support buildings (e.g., offices and training). Project indirect costs increased due to the extended project schedule and a larger workforce, overlapping project construction and completion activities.(millions)2024 Revised ScenarioInitial Capex2025 Updated ScenarioInitial CapexVarianceMining$83.80$100.20$16.40Mineral Processing Plant$64.80$78.00$13.20Site Infrastructure$56.20$58.40$2.20Total Direct Costs$204.80$236.60$31.80Owner Costs$33.30$50.30$17.00Project Indirect Costs$24.20$45.10$20.90Contingency$8.70-($8.70)Total Indirect Costs$66.20$95.40$29.20Total (Direct & Indirect)$271.00$332.00$61.00Next Steps and PlanningThe Terronera Project is anticipated to begin full system commissioning in early Q2 2025.For Q1 2025, Upper Platform efforts will focus on installing remaining items, punch list completion, and commissioning.

        "content": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 6, 2025) -Southern Silver Exploration Corp.(TSXV: SSV) (the \"Company\" or \"Southern Silver\") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a letter agreement with La Cuesta International, S.A. de C.V. to acquire the Nazas exploration project in Durango, Mexico.The letter agreement provides Southern Silver the option to earn a 100% interest in the Nazas project by (i) making pre-production cash payments totalling US$130,000 over a 36 month period with a pre-production payment of US$25,000 payable every 6 months thereafter; and (ii) completing a minimum aggregate 8,000 metres of drilling on the project over a 4 year period. The Company will also pay US$25,000 in reimbursement of concession rights taxes. The project is subject to net smelter return royalty in the amount of 2% of net smelter returns on the current claims, 1% net smelter returns on any new claims acquired within an area of influence, and 0.5% of net smelter returns on any third party owned lands acquired within the area of influence. The net smelter return royalty will be reduced by half upon cumulative pre-production payments and net smelter return royalty payments totalling US$10 million.The Nazas Ag-Au-Pb-Zn property comprises 5 claims totaling 2,189 ha and is located on the eastern flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountain range in north-central Durango State, Mexico. The Nazas property is accessible by road from the City of Durango, located approximately 160km to the south.The property sits within the heart of Mexico's Faja de Plata (Belt of Silver) and is located just 15km to the east of Endeavor Silver's Pitarilla Deposit, one of the largest unexploited silver resources in Mexico. The property features similar host stratigraphy and mineralizing systems to Pitarilla with a high potential to host significant epithermal vein, porphyry and replacement-styled mineral deposits.Figure 1: Location of Southern Silver's Nazas and Cerro Las Minitas projects, Durango MexicoModern exploration of the Nazas project started in the mid-1990s by the vendor which staked it and adjacent ground, including the Pitarilla Property, on behalf of Silver Standard Resources Inc (now SSR Mining Inc.). SSR Mining sold the Pitarilla Project to Endeavor Silver Corp. in January 2022 and ceased exploration operations in Mexico returning the Nazas property to the vendors.The property was extensively explored from the early 2000's through to the mid-2010's resulting in a comprehensive database that includes:Property wide geological mappingSeveral thousand rock and soil samples collectedChannel samplingProperty wide clay alteration studiesMagnetic, IP, Gravimetric and Magneto-telluric geophysical surveys over select target areas; andResults from 18 drill holes totaling 4,070 metres (12 RC and 6 DDH)Seven different targets are identified on the property which will be the focus of future exploration on the property.Multiple epithermal vein occurrences occur throughout the property and are characterized by fine quartz stockworks localized along cross-cutting NW-SE and NE-SW-trending structures often enveloped within broad gold-enriched haloes, up to 60 metres wide, of oxidized hematite-goethite-bearing rock. Drilling by Silver Standard at the Yerbabuena and Santa Rita targets returned strongly anomalous Au-Ag mineralization (+0.1g/t Au and +1g/t Ag) over 10s of metres in multiple drill holes. Mineralization remains open both laterally and at depth for further testing.Note that the reported mineralization is from historic records and has not been independently validated by the author.Deeper stratigraphy and associated base-metal-enriched mineralization is exposed at the Yescas prospect reflecting the potential for both porphyry and replacement styled mineralization. Three quartz-feldspar intrusive phases have been identified on the property and are similar to those associated with the Pitarilla deposit.Upcoming work on the Nazas project will focus on validation of the historic surface and drill data and further compilation and interpretation of what is a substantive database toward establishing drill targets for testing in Q3 2025.Consulting Agreement with La Cuesta International, Inc.Southern Silver has agreed to enter into a consulting agreement with La Cuesta International, Inc. pursuant to which La Cuesta International, Inc. will provide technical advisory services with respect to the Nazas project as well as the Company's other Mexican projects. Southern Silver will issue 100,000 common shares in the capital of the Company in consideration of such services.

        "content": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 5, 2025) -Riverside Resources Inc.(TSXV: RRI) (OTCQB: RVSDF) (FSE: 5YY) (\"Riverside\" or the \"Company\"),is pleased to announce that the next stage of exploration is now progressing, following the successful completion of the joint Q4 2024 drilling program at the Cecilia Gold Project in Sonora, Mexico.The drill program was conducted in partnership with Fortuna Mining, which continues to advance their earn-in option on the project (See news release: March 13, 2024). Riverside, acting as the operator, completed an initial five-hole, 2,250-meter drilling campaign designed to test four distinct target areas generally with one geological evaluation drill hole per target to seek scale and evidence of a potentially strong hydrothermal system which would set up for a follow up 2025 exploration program which has now begun. The drilling in Q4 hit favorable indicators as outlined below and continued to develop the district scale targets both at Cerro Magallanes and on the broader >60 km sq property package with vast areas to expand.The drill program announced in September (See press release: September 10, 2024), where Riverside outlined its goals to define and expand key targets at Cecilia. The latest program hit gold mineralization in each target area and broader epithermal alteration consistent with target styles like the nearby Mercedes Mine Sonora and Oatman Gold District Arizona. At Magallanes Hill, two holes were drilled at the San Jose target, followed by one hole on the eastern flank, referred to as the East Target. Additionally, two holes were drilled in the Mesa area to the south: one testing the Mayra Vein concept and the final hole drilled eastward to intersect the Mesa Fault, a significant structural target.\"We are encouraged by the results of the Q4 2024 drilling program, which focused on testing geological features with limited previous drilling, just one or two holes in each area, and yielded positive indicators while also uncovering some unexpected geologic surprises,\" said John-Mark Staude, President and CEO of Riverside Resources. \"This program not only confirmed earlier gold intercepts but also expanded the scale of exploration with significant step-outs and new target areas. The ongoing work underscores our commitment to unlocking new opportunities and delivering sustained value to our stakeholders.\"Highlights of the Drill Program:San Jose Vein System (North Breccia): Two holes were drilled to extend testing of this structure, building upon results from previous drilling and assay work. The San Jose system has shown significant mineralization potential, as highlighted in prior programs including samples returning values of up to48.3 g/t Au over 0.75 mat surface (See press release: January 28, 2021). Drilling to depths of 500 to 800 meters successfully intersected the San Jose structure in both holes, confirming the continuity of this extensive vein system. Notably, hole CED24-010 returned an intercept of3.41 g/t Au over 4 meters, starting at a depth of 76 meters, with an additional lower intercept including0.39 g/t Au over 5.25mstarting at 319m identified along the projected extension of the San Jose vein which topographically is over 500m below the Magallanes peak and previous drill intercepts in the upper part of the San Jose vein system. These results are illustrated in the cross-section below.East Target: A single hole was drilled perpendicular to known mineralization identified in surface samples and previous drilling by Cambior (1996). This hole crossed through thick zones of alteration, adding valuable geological data for this target and confirming that Cecilia has strong feeder zones for gold. The hole intersected at least 6 gold bearing intervals with one being0.38 g/t Au over 1.75mstarting from 149.25m. This hole was drilled eastward in order to constrain the dip as past drill holes had been drilled westward. The single new hole intercepted multiple veins for this part of the eastern Magallanes system as shown on the map below and on the Company websiteMesa Ranch Area (Mayra Vein): The 2024 program was the first time the Mayra Vein has been tested with this the first drill to be conducted on the broader Cecilia project, which encompasses over a dozen identified targets. This hole was intended to test the northwest trending epithermal veins related with felsic dikes that potentially feed toward and likely cut the Puma Dome. These district-scale targets from the Mesa Ranch area have potential along strike for further exploration. Core drill hole CED24-011 intersected multiple vein zones, including an interval of 0.21 g/t Au over 2 meters starting at 281 meters. The gold-bearing interval featured quartz veining and oxides whose projection aligns with surface-sampled veins that extend over 700 meters along strike, further highlighting the potential and continued interest in these vein systems.South Mesa Fault Zone (Mesa South): The final hole of the program focused on the extensive South Mesa Fault; a 10 km-long structure comparable to fault-controlled gold systems like those in Nevada's Midas District. Drill hole CED24-012 intersected the fault at 110m and comprises a 5m thick interval of sheared brecciated rock which can be projected to surface and followed along strike. Surface samples returned gold values of over 2 g/t gold along the surface projection of this fault. Plans are in place for additional exploration of the Mesa South region for the first half of 2025, which will include tracking the Mesa fault's continuity along strike.The table below summarizes the locations and depths for the five holes completed in this first drilling round with Fortuna Mining.The drilling location map below shows the 5 holes (3 drill pads) which correlate with the drill hole descriptive table above. Drill hole CED24-008 at Magallanes was deeper than any previous drilling. Figure 1 shows the drill traces as they intersected the down dip projection of the veins.Figure 1- Geology map and location of the five 2024 drill holes shown in red. The straight and thin black lines near Magallanes are drill holes from previous campaigns. This new program stepped out to test the East Target (CED24-009) and the Mayras and South Mesa with single holes.The cross-section figure below highlights hole CED24-010 from the drill program, which demonstrates the intersections of multiple vein structures. These structures are now interpreted to potentially extend over 800 meters vertically, suggesting they could be part of a significant epithermal system. Further exploration is planned for 2025, including an MT (Magneto-telluric) geophysical survey to refine our targeting of the system. Based on the results of these surveys, additional drilling may be undertaken to further evaluate the system's potential. The Project includes numerous untested targets throughout the 60 km sq land package.Figure 2:Cross section of the Magallanes Dome showing the volcanic units and structuresThis drill program advanced the understanding of the Cecilia system's geology, confirming significant low-sulfidation epithermal features in the Cerro Magallanes area. Data from the drilling suggests the mineralization system is tilted southeast, supported by surface mapping, geochemical analysis, and structural modeling.The Cecilia Gold Project continues to demonstrate significant potential. Fortuna Mining's technical expertise and funding have enabled systematic exploration, with the partnership potentially targeting a larger follow-up program in 2025. The drilling positively demonstrated scale and alterations consistent with a mineralized system worthy of more advanced drilling in addition to continued target testing.Stock Option Grant:On February 4th, 2025, the Company granted 1,450,000 incentive stock options (the \"Options\") to certain Directors, Officers and Consultants of the Company.

        "link": "https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1242-tsx/txg/174721-torex-gold-provides-q4-2024-update-on-media-luna-project.html",
        "content": "Construction substantially complete and first copper concentrate on track for March(All amounts expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated)Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - February 4, 2025) -Torex Gold Resources Inc.(the \"Company\" or \"Torex\") (TSX: TXG) provides a Q4 2024 update on the development of its Media Luna Project (\"Media Luna\"). Unless otherwise stated, progress and milestones referenced in this press release are as of December 31, 2024.Jody Kuzenko, President & CEO of Torex, stated: \"The Media Luna Project is now in its final months, sitting at 94% complete as of the end of 2024. We are well on track to complete the project and produce first copper concentrate by the end of Q1 2025, with engineering concluded, procurement substantially complete, underground development tracking well ahead of schedule, and surface construction advancing per plan.\"The tie-ins at the processing plant are on track to commence towards the end of February, with all major deliveries required to support the tie-in period now on site. In Q4, teams were able to take advantage of a planned maintenance period at the process plant and conducted initial synchronization and testing of the variable frequency drives for the ball mill, which we expect will streamline and de-risk the installation process and support efficient commissioning in March.\"Average monthly underground lateral development rates remained ahead of budget at 1,300 meters per month. Definition drilling is also well ahead of plan, with drilling for 2024 stopes completed ahead of schedule, most of the stopes planned to be mined in 2025 drilled off, and drilling for 2026 underway. Our target is to have a minimum of one year of stope inventory on hand going forward. With an excellent head start on both definition drilling and underground development, which will further accelerate in 2025, we now expect to achieve the designed mining rate of 7,500 tonnes per day by mid-2026, six months ahead of the schedule set out in the Technical Report.\"In terms of project capital, Q1 2025 is expected to be the last quarter of material investment in Media Luna and, with commercial production expected in early Q2 2025, we are well-positioned to pivot back to positive free cash flow generation by mid-year. The robust free cash flow anticipated from Morelos places Torex in a solid position to quickly repay the modest level of debt taken on to fund Media Luna, begin returning capital to shareholders, and support increased investment in our plans for continued growth at Morelos and beyond.\"CAPITAL EXPENDITURESDuring Q4 2024, approximately $100 million was spent on Media Luna, bringing the total annual spend to $449 million, within the updated guidance range of $430 to $450 million. Expenditures in Q1 2025 are expected to be lower than the quarterly spend in 2024 as the project winds down, first copper concentrate production begins, and commercial production is declared shortly thereafter.As a result of the previously announced rescheduling of the processing plant tie-ins to February (originally November 2024), the pre-commercial period has been extended by approximately three months. As per full-year guidance, the Company is expected to invest approximately $60 million of non-sustaining capital expenditures in 2025 at Media Luna primarily during the pre-commercial period. Of this amount, approximately half is related to underground development, which would have otherwise been categorized as sustaining in nature under the original November 2024 tie-in schedule. This expenditure includes accelerated underground development with a view to achieving steady-state mining rates six months ahead of the schedule set out in the Technical Report. The remainder of the forecast non-sustaining expenditures at Media Luna in 2025 primarily relate to finalization of surface construction activities, including the plant tie-in and paste plant construction.PROJECT COMPLETIONAs at year end, overall development of Media Luna was 94% complete, up from 87% at the start of the quarter. Engineering was concluded in Q3 2024, with teams continuing to support in the field as necessary to address any installation issues. Procurement is substantially complete at 99% and underground and surface development/construction are advancing, with completion levels at 90% and 85%, respectively. The largest outstanding item in the category of surface construction is the paste plant, which is on schedule for construction completion and commissioning in early Q2.Progress on the project was halted by the eight-day temporary suspension of activities at Morelos in early December; as a result, the start of the four-week tie-in of the copper (\"Cu\") and iron sulphide (\"FeS\") flotation circuits as well as the modifications to the processing plant has shifted from early to late February. First concentrate production is expected at the end of Q1, and the declaration of commercial production shortly thereafter.Table 1:Media Luna Project - Project Completion (April 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024)Project To DateQ4 2024Procurement99%Engineering100%Underground development/construction90%Surface construction (including paste plant)85%Total Project94%Notes to Table1) Physical progress measured starting as of April 1, 2022; excludes progress made prior to Board approval on March 31, 2022.2) Project period is defined as April 1, 2022 through declaration of commercial production.3) Total Project is weighted average based on activity levels.ProcurementWith procurement for the project 99% complete as of the end of Q4 2024, only minor deliveries remain outstanding, including automated valves, instrumentation, and some underground pipe for the paste plant distribution system. All major deliveries to support the start-up of Media Luna operations are now on site.Notable orders completed during Q4 included the remaining electrical houses (\"e-houses\") for the processing plant, the backup generator for the 230 kV switchyard, slurry pumps, and carbon steel pipe.Underground Development and ConstructionSteady progress continued underground at Media Luna, with 90% of project construction and development achieved as at year end. Definition drilling for the stopes planned to be taken in the 2024 mine plan were completed well ahead of schedule, most of the drilling in the 2025 mine plan is now complete, and definition drilling for the 2026 mine plan has commenced. The Company is targeting to have one year of stope inventory on hand going forward.Underground development rates continue to track ahead of plan, with monthly lateral development rates averaging 1,300 metres since July relative to the original budget of 1,200 metres, excluding the impact of the temporary suspension of activities at Morelos in December. With the significant progress made to date on both definition drilling and underground development, the Company now expects mining rates at Media Luna to achieve the designed rate of 7,500 tonnes per day by mid-2026, six months ahead of the schedule set out in the Technical Report.Construction and commissioning of rock breaker #1 is now complete (Figure 1). Installation of the fire suppression system for the Guajes conveyor commenced, as did installation of the 15 kV electrical cables along the length of the tunnel. Teams also completed the installation of the first vertical pipe for the tailings line and have commenced work on the backup second line, all with a view to derisking paste plant commissioning.Figure 1:Rock breaker #1 and the grizzly chute have been installed and commissioned.Surface ConstructionSurface construction is now 85% complete, up from 70% at the start of the quarter. On the north side of the Balsas River, the switchgear and transformers for all three e-houses required for the flotation circuit were energized during the quarter. Importantly, initial synchronization and testing of the variable frequency drives for the ball mill were completed during December, with a view to derisking commissioning in February (Figure 2). At the flotation circuit, flotation cell gear reducers were installed, agitator shafts were aligned, and compressors for dart valves are now in operation to allow for water testing of the primary flotation cells. Concrete has been poured on the truck scale at the Cu loadout area and construction of the Cu storage facility is progressing well with the roof system, tripper, and transfer conveyors in place. Vertical grinding mills have been constructed and are ready for final vendor inspection.Installation of power infrastructure is now substantially complete, with the low voltage 115 kV system fully energized and operational, and the transmission line between the 230 kV switchyard and substation completed in the quarter (Figure 3). At the switchyard, crews continued to pull cable in the duct banks and trenches and installed battery banks. Additionally, the transformer for the underground control room has now been energized.On the south side of the Balsas River, construction of the paste plant is advancing well. The elevated floor slab at the filter level has been poured allowing for preparation for the assembly of the main filter presses, and assembly and welding continues on the exterior tanks. Electrical panels are being mounted in the e-house. Steel erection sits at 66% complete, with 1,336 tonnes out of 2,020 tonnes installed (Figure 4).Figure 2:Pre-commissioning of the ball mill's variable frequency drives took place in December in order to mitigate potential risks during the tie-in period in February.Figure 3:Transmission lines between the 230 kV switchyard (pictured below) and substation were connected in the quarter.Figure 4:Work progressed on the paste plant during the quarter, including continued erection of the binder silo, thickener, and building steel.Operational ReadinessIn parallel with development and construction activities, the surface and underground operational readiness plan continues to progress. The operational readiness team continues to develop and advance Standard Operating and Maintenance procedures for the new assets and is tracking to plan at over 77% complete. Central to the operational readiness plan is the workforce transition, with a view to ensuring the labour and staff personnel required to operate Media Luna and the modified process plant are in place and trained as appropriate. At the end of 2024, 83% of the total planned workforce at Media Luna was in place, which involved the recruitment of 136 people and transfer of 197 employees over the course of the year. The work ahead is to finalize the workforce transition through local, regional, and national recruitment and continued transfer of employees from the open pit operations to the Media Luna underground mine.Negotiations with the various haulage companies for Cu concentrate transport to port distribution facilities are complete and contracts executed. The Company is also in the final stages of executing contracts for the sale of Cu concentrate to a mix of traders and smelters. Metal payables are in line with that which was incorporated into the most recent Technical Report dated effective March 16, 2022 and filed on March 31, 2022 (\"Technical Report\").PROJECT EXECUTION PLANBased on progress made to date and a detailed review of both the surface and underground schedules completed late in the quarter, modest updates have been made to the overall project schedule after incorporating the impact of the temporary suspension of activities at Morelos in early December (Figure 5).More detail on the Media Luna Project, including the Feasibility Study results, can be found in the Technical Report.Figure 5:Project execution plan for the Media Luna Project.ABOUT TOREX GOLD RESOURCES INC.Torex is an intermediate gold producer based in Canada, engaged in the exploration, development, and operation of its 100% owned Morelos Property, an area of 29,000 hectares in the highly prospective Guerrero Gold Belt located 180 kilometres southwest of Mexico City.

        "content": "New drilling significantly expands the high-grade gold and silver mineralization of the Navidad discoveryMetallurgical testing demonstrates excellent gold and silver recoveries for Navidad mineralizationVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 4, 2025) -First Majestic Silver Corp.(NYSE: AG) (TSX: AG) (FSE: FMV) (the \"Company\" or \"First Majestic\") is pleased to provide new results for the Navidad discovery at its Santa Elena Silver/Gold Mine in Sonora, Mexico that was first announced onJuly 30, 2024. The drilling completed during the second half of 2024 (\"H2\") significantly expanded the gold and silver mineralization discovered at the Navidad Target (\"Navidad\"), and metallurgical testing of the mineralization revealed that gold and silver metal recoveries are excellent.\"The success at Santa Elena continues,\" stated Keith Neumeyer, President & CEO of First Majestic. \"The exploration program at Navidad during H2 successfully expanded the high-grade gold and silver mineralization of the Navidad discovery, extending mineralization closer to the Ermitaño mine infrastructure. We anticipate continued success at Santa Elena during 2025 as we work to grow and define the mineral deposit at Navidad. We are very excited by the potential of this new discovery, which we believe represents a high-quality opportunity to grow the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve base both for the Santa Elena operation and for the Company as a whole.\"H2 2024 NAVIDAD EXPLORATION HIGHLIGHTSDrilling of Navidad since the discovery announcement in July 2024, has substantially expanded the footprint of gold (\"Au\") and silver (\"Ag\") mineralization. A total of 20,809 metres (\"m\") of new drilling was completed with 17-holes that have defined extensive mineralization consisting of two epithermal quartz veins with high-grade gold and silver mineralization: the Navidad and Winter veins. The gold and silver mineralization identified to date extends greater than 1,000m by 300m in strike and dip with the true thickness of mineralization averaging between 2.8m and 4.4m. A maiden Inferred Mineral Resource estimate is anticipated to be released in late March.During 2025, additional drilling from surface is planned to continue testing the potential expansion of Navidad, which remains open in multiple directions. Expansionary and infill resource definition drilling will also take place from multiple new underground drilling stations constructed from the Ermitaño mine. Five drill rigs are currently active at Navidad.Independent third-party metallurgical testing of Navidad and Winter mineralization under current mineral processing parameters for the Santa Elena processing plant was completed during the fall of 2024. The testing revealed exceptional gold and silver recovery rates with gold recoveries consistently exceeding 90% and silver recoveries exceeding 85%. The results firmly establish that Navidad's mineralization is compatible with the existing processing infrastructure at the Santa Elena operation.KEY DRILLING HIGHLIGHTSA summary of high-grade assay results from exploration drilling completed at Navidad during the second half of 2024 is provided in Table 1 and includes the highlighted true-width intervals that follow:Navidad Mineral ProjectWinter Vein HighlightsHole EW-24-371:4.30 m at 5.12 g/t Au & 43 g/t AgAnd: 1.22 m at 9.72 g/t Au & 76 g/t AgHole EW-24-372-A:4.83 m at 8.60 g/t Au & 77 g/t AgHole EW-24-373:6.06 m at 5.64 g/t Au & 104 g/t AgHole EW-24-377:3.30 m at 7.09 g/t Au & 1,253 g/t AgHole EW-24-379:1.72 m at 1.57 g/t Au & 119 g/t AgHole EW-24-380:3.07 m at 4.27 g/t Au & 57 g/t AgHole EW-24-382:2.66 m at 13.93 g/t Au & 99 g/t AgHole EW-24-383:1.38 m at 0.42 g/t Au & 1,064 g/t AgAnd: 1.26 m at 0.32 g/t Au & 461 g/t AgHole EW-24-384:1.59 m at 6.40 g/t Au & 110 g/t AgAnd: 1.04 m at 5.62 g/t Au & 46 g/t AgHole EWUG-24-035:5.62 m at 2.89 g/t Au & 50 g/t AgNavidad Vein HighlightsHole EW-24-372-A:3.24 m at 13.06 g/t Au & 205 g/t AgHole EW-24-374:2.63 m at 0.54 g/t Au & 221 g/t AgHole EW-24-377:1.59 m at 1.60 g/t Au & 135 g/t AgHole EW-24-379:2.32 m at 7.09 g/t Au & 38 g/t AgHole EW-24-380:1.27 m at 2.08 g/t Au & 120 g/t AgHole EW-24-381:1.69 m at 0.92 g/t Au & 128 g/t AgAnd: 1.03 m at 1.19 g/t Au & 144 g/t AgHole EW-24-384:2.58 m at 1.44 g/t Au & 139 g/t AgAnd: 1.35 m at 2.90 g/t Au & 354 g/t AgHole EW-24-386:1.18 m at 2.82 g/t Au & 118 g/t AgHole EWUG-24-035:4.78 m at 1.36 g/t Au & 115 g/t AgDISTRICT EXPLORATION APPROACHExploration for gold and silver mineral deposits at Santa Elena is guided by a newly developed understanding of the rocks most likely to host mineralized veins within the volcanic stratigraphy as well as by the timing of mineralizing events in the district. Detailed mapping, geologic interpretation and geochronological studies have led the exploration team to recognize that Santa Elena and Ermitaño-style mineral deposits formed in favorable host-rocks that are concealed beneath extensive regions of overlying volcanic rocks. Drilling beneath the overlying volcanic rocks and other post-mineral volcanic rocks in 2024 has confirmed the favorable host-rock concept and led to the discovery of the Navidad Target (Figure 1). For 2024, a total of 58,311m of exploration drilling was completed on the Santa Elena property, a 21% increase compared to 2023.Figure 1:Santa Elena Property 2024 Schematic Map of the Navidad Target Area. Plan View.Navidad TargetAs a result of H2 drilling, the Navidad discovery location has been confirmed to occur approximately 100m southwest and 350m below the Ermitaño underground mine levels, significantly closer than what the Company had previously stated, which was 500m southwest and 750m below the mine levels. Drilling is ongoing with 20,809m completed in 17 drill holes during the second half of 2024 for a total of 31,500m in this target area during 2024. The drilling significantly expanded the known mineralization and delineated two quartz veins that possess high-grade gold and silver mineralization: the Navidad and Winter veins. The epithermal vein deposits consist of grey to pink, banded quartz and quartz vein stockwork that contain visible silver sulphides and locally visible native gold grains, both detectable by handheld X-Ray Florescence Analyzer (Figure 2 and Figure 3).The Winter vein occurs approximately 180m structurally above and sub-parallel to the underlying Navidad vein; both veins are surrounded by quartz stockwork (Figure 4). Significant gold and silver mineralization intersected within the Winter vein currently extends 600m by 350m along strike and dip and the mineralization ranges from 0.65m to 6.6m in thickness (Figure 5). Mineralization intersected to date within the Navidad vein extends 1,000m by 300m along strike and dip and the mineralization ranges from 0.5m to 5.0m in thickness (Figure 6).Independent third-party metallurgical tests demonstrate robust gold and silver recovery rates for the Navidad and Winter mineralization, exceeding 90% and 85%, respectively. These results confirm each vein's compatibility with Santa Elena's existing processing facility. Initial grindability tests indicate the material is slightly softer than Ermitaño's mineralization, potentially enabling increased plant throughput.During 2025, the drilling will explore for expansion of the Navidad/Winter mineralization from surface. The full extent of the gold and silver vein system is not yet known, and the potential to expand the mineralization remains open in several directions. Extensive infill resource definition drilling will also be completed primarily from new underground drilling stations within the Ermitaño mine.Figure 2:Core Photography of the Winter Vein with High-Grade Gold and Silver Mineralization detected by XRF Analyzer.Hole EW-24-373 Assay Results: 6.06 m at 5.64 g/t Au and 104 g/t Ag.Figure 3:Core Photography of the Navidad Vein with High-Grade Gold and Silver Mineralization detected by XRF Analyzer.Hole EW-24-372A Assay Results: 3.24 m at 13.06 g/t Au and 206 g/t Ag.Figure 4:Navidad Vein System Detail.

A maximum of 1.0 m below the minimum grade cut-off was allowed as internal dilution. Where necessary to achieve minimum length, a single sample below the COG but grading >75g/t AgEq was allowed to be composited for short intervals.Where present, single samples or intercepts with assay results higher than 1000 g/t Ag and/or 10 g/t Au are highlighted as \"Include\" in each intercept.First Majestic's drilling programs follow established Quality Assurance, Quality Control (\"QA/QC\") insertion protocols with standards, blanks, and duplicates introduced into the sample-stream. After geological logging, all drill core samples are cut in half. One half of the core is submitted to the laboratory for analysis and the remaining half core is retained on-site for verification and reference purposes or for future metallurgical testing.Core samples were submitted to the SGS laboratory (ISO/IEC 17025:2017). At SGS, gold is analyzed by 30g or 50g fire assay atomic absorption finish (GE-FAA30V5, GE-FAA50V5). Results above 10 g/t gold are analyzed by 30 g or 50g fire assay gravimetric finish (GO-FAG30V, GO-FAG50V). Silver is analyzed by 3-acid digest atomic absorption finish (GE-AAS33E50). Results above 100 g/t silver are analyzed by 30g or 50g fire assay gravimetric finish (GO-FAG37V, GO-FAG57V).Core samples from the Navidad and Winter deposits were subjected to bottle roll cyanidation tests at the SGS laboratory (ISO/IEC 17025:2017) under conditions replicating those of the Santa Elena Unit processing plant, including the 40 µm HIGmill product target. The methods used to analyze the products of these tests were GE_FAA3OV5, GE_AAS33E50, GL_AA582T.For further information concerning QA/QC and data verification matters, key assumptions, parameters, and methods used by the Company to estimate Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, and for a detailed description of known legal, political, environmental, and other risks that could materially affect the Company's business and the potential development of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, see the Company's most recently filed Annual Information Form available under the Company's SEDAR+ profile atwww.sedarplus.caand the Company's Annual Report on Form 40-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR atwww.sec.gov/edgar.QUALIFIED PERSONSGonzalo Mercado, P.

        "content": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 4, 2025) -Kingsmen Resources Ltd. (TSXV: KNG) (OTCQB: KNGRF)(\"Kingsmen\"or the \"Company\") is pleased to report results from on its continuing exploration program on its 100% owned Las Coloradas project, which is in the Parral mining district of the Central Mexican Silver Belt, Chihuahua Mexico.President, Scott Emerson, commented:We have now completed exploration over the entire 1.7 km and 1.4 km long Soledad and Soledad II structures with mineralization occurring over the entire strike lengths. This gives us confidence that mineralization continues along strike and at depth of the past producing Las Coloradas mine (300M) and also increases our confidence for our upcoming drill program.Kingsmen has identified a new target area (DBD) for diamond drilling. This is in addition to the Mine, Aguilar and Leona target areas previously announced. The DBD target covers an area of historic underground artisanal mining between the Mine and Leona zones on the Soledad structure (Figure 1, Figure 2 (enlarged scale) and Table 1). The old underground workings show stopes up to 5 meters wide and 4.0 meters high. Where the mineralized structure rolls and flattens dilatant zones up to 3.0 meters can form. All historic workings have been above the water table (+/- 125 meters). As with all the target areas there has been no drilling to test the mineralization at depth where blind extensions to the mineralized structures, as well as new structures, are likely at depth.Figure 1Figure 2There are strong similarities/parallels with the mineralization in the underground Santa Barbara mine where vein systems vary from 3 to 6.5 km along strike and the vertical extension of the shoots have a vertical extension of up to 900 meters.The Las Coloradas mineralization is on the southeast flank of a prominent aeromagnetic high interpreted to be a buried felsic intrusive body. The felsic intrusives associated with the Soledad and other structures are likely linked to this body and the setting is favourable for porphyry, skarn and epithermal vein mineralization.Table 1SampleWidth (m)Ag ppmAu ppmCu ppmPb ppmZn ppm11201.980.2052891708010686020.990.280.033387050192031.10.50.00559.67212540.882.30.02150.7105202077050.719.80.01465.423701074060.62.90.002551.9251114070.680.80.126136132003013080.7540.06462.949801223090.628.70.02140.8343010070100.7268.420.35988.741180101060111.214.90.06264.120102850121.240.50.03156.3255011670131.321.40.08947.720706510141.238.10.01298.155201660015133.70.002593.2539013490161.128.50.002569.560006460171.343.60.20679.1591037810181.123.90.10439.626704250190.915.90.002563.822701730201.2480.51733.3176011730210.811.40.00659.616603650221.1242.870.0261564441047880230.775.40.24185.4900137290240.951.70.18475.8576023240251.2130.03241.218503240261.193.540.079991925033790270.9308.160.24121344790210440280.8198.340.33451.84984050720290.9187.480.72679.33863066110300.8395.870.4571844577035310310.841.50.1391431320239270320.830.80.00639.675204180330.773.20.07399.8837937590340.7170.00656.818507020350.5335.230.26717133140106220361.641.70.00742.478205620371.425.80.03249.7305011990381.16.80.01635.98741990391.427.50.00773.6255013690401.17.110.002534.513501170410.8168.650.45346.63077016210All samples were analyzed by ALS Chemex, Chihuahua.

The Restart will require a change of use of soils permit prior to commencing which the company expects to receive in 2025. High AISCs reflect US$4.2M of capital and two months of waste stripping costs. The San Agustin Operations, Durango, Mexico, NI 43-101 Technical Report supports AISCs of US$1,790 for life of mine (excluding mine closure costs).Metal prices estimated at US$2,400 per ounce gold and $28 per ounce gold price.Cash costs and AISC are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this news release for further information on this measure.AISC is based on World Gold Council definition.Annual average exchange rate from all costs based on Mexican peso to US dollar (nineteen pesos per one dollar).At La Colorada, exploration work during the second half of 2024 confirmed the potential to exploit metals from previously stockpiled material known as the Junkyard Stockpile. Mining operations were restarted at La Colorada from the Junkyard Stockpile in January 2025 and it is planned that production will continue through the year.At San Agustin, residual production is continuing into 2025. The Company has submitted a permit application to expand the open pit that would allow mining operations at San Agustin to recommence in 2025. Initial capital requirements result in an elevated Cash Cost and AISC for the San Agustin Restart in 2025. This is expected to materially reduce in 2026 with the San Agustin Operations, Durango, Mexico, NI 43-101 Technical Report supporting an AISC of US$1,790 for life of mine (excluding mine closure costs).Drilling and technical trade-off studies will continue at Ana Paula.

Our ongoing efforts to improve efficiency, contain costs, apply operational discipline and reduce dilution, combined with completion of the transition to narrow vein mining methods appropriate for future production from the Marianas deposit, are focused on benefitting Mercedes' performance in 2025.\"Q4 2024 ProductionProduction and development results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024 are as follows:Q1 2024(1)Q2 2024(1)Q3 2024(1)Q4 2024Full Year 2024(2)Ore Mined (tonnes)106,36593,093103,88995,204398,552Ore Processed (tonnes)109,28095,727102,53593,170400,771Gold grade processed (gpt)3.693.233.402.793.30Gold recovery (%)94%93%96%95%95%Gold ounces produced12,2289,30410,7517,93740,220Silver ounces produced44,04040,89376,93955,803217,675Development (meters)2,7802,5692,0253,09010,464(1) See Bear Creek news releases dated April 17, July 19 and October 18, 2024(2) Full year 2024 numbers may not add due to roundingThe tonnage of ore mined and processed was impacted during Q4 2024 by delays experienced in obtaining certain equipment and supplies necessary to transition from the bulk mining methods used at the San Martin deposit to narrow vein mining methods required to effectively mine at the Marianas deposit and delays related to unplanned remediation of ground conditions. While as a result the final quarter of the year saw lower than anticipated gold and silver production, we are working to resolve both of these underlying factors and improve production accordingly. The average Q4 2024 gold grade of processed ore was impacted by lower-than-expected grades of ore mined from the Diluvio and Lupita deposits. Development activity originally planned for earlier quarters occurred in the final quarter of the year, leading to the substantially higher development meters achieved in Q4 2024.In summary, unforeseen delays related to the transition of mining methods and contractors during the quarter negatively impacted production results for Q4 2024. However, the majority of this shortfall is expected to be made up in the course of 2025 concurrent with anticipated reductions in dilution that stem from using experienced narrow vein miners and right sized equipment.Bear Creek is planning an aggressive exploration program for 2025 to test high quality, near-mine brownfield targets identified in late 2024 through a study that integrated new information obtained from reprocessing historic aeromagnetic survey data, with ground-based geochemistry, new geological field observations and a re-interpretation of structural controls on Mercedes mineralization. The 69,284-hectare Mercedes property is located at the convergence of discrete porphyry, epithermal & orogenic belts and represents a highly prospective environment that is largely unexplored outside of the Mercedes mine deposits. Our 2025 exploration plans will be announced in an exploration update news release in the coming days.Shipping AlternativesBear Creek, through its Mercedes operating entity, currently ships d'ore from the Mercedes Mine to refining facilities in the USA pursuant to a contract with Asahi Refining (\"Asahi\"). The Company has confirmed that alternative d'ore shipping arrangements to Asahi's facilities in Canada are available to it, and will avail itself of these alternatives in the event precious metals shipments from Mexico to the USA become subject to punitive tariffs. Should this occur, the net effect of the change for the Company would be a moderate increase in the transportation costs for the production from Mercedes.On behalf of the Board of Directors,Eric CabaPresident and Chief Executive OfficerFor further information contact:Barbara Henderson - VP Corporate CommunicationsDirect: 604-628-1111E-mail:This email address is being protected from spambots.

(“Prime” or the “Company”) (TSX: PRYM) (OTCQX: PRMNF) (Frankfurt: 04V3)is reporting expansion drilling results from the Company’s Los Reyes Project (the “Project”), located in Sinaloa State, Mexico. These results are from 2024 drilling at theCentralTrend and are not included in the Company’s October 15, 2024, Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”).Expansion Drilling Highlights in the Central TrendThe Company is reporting 14 core holes at the Central Trend, 9 of which are fromNoche Buena, at the southernmost part of the trend,with the following highlights:3.48 grams per tonne (“g/t”) gold-equivalent (“AuEq”) (3.12 g/t Au and 27.7 g/t Ag) over 7.6 m estimated true width (“ETW”) in hole 24NB-78, including:8.64 g/t AuEq (7.8 g/t Au and 64.8 g/t Ag) over 2.8 m ETW, including:16.22 g/t AuEq (15.00 g/t Au and 94.0 g/t Ag) over 1.4 m ETW;2.16 g/t AuEq (1.75 g/t Au and 31.9 g/t Ag) over 11.3 m ETW in hole 24NB-67, including:8.65 g/t AuEq (7.42 g/t Au and 95.3 g/t Ag) over 2.3 m ETW;1.65 g/t AuEq (1.03 g/t Au and 47.6 g/t Ag) over 11.2 m ETW in hole 24NB-77, including:4.24 g/t AuEq (2.40 g/t Au and 142.0 g/t Ag) over 1.8 m ETW.Prime Mining Corp. Chief Executive Officer Scott Hicks commented, “Step-out drill holes at the southernmost end of Noche Buena in the Central Trend returned excellent gold and silver grades, defining a brand new high-grade shoot that is several hundred meters beyond our October 2024 resource update. Mineralization is at grades and widths indicative of underground expansion potential. And, mineralization remains open at depth and along strike to the south, with strong potential for significant extension via the 2025 drilling currently underway.”Scott Smith, Executive Vice President of Exploration, added, “This high-grade extension, defined by drillholes 24NB-77, -78, -73, and -74, confirms a 300-metre, high-grade shoot along strike from current stopes defined in our last MRE. The downdip extent of this high-grade shoot has been defined at over 120 metres, remains open, and presents an opportunity to add a significant volume of inferred stopes with follow-up drilling. We are excited for 2025 to bring a continuation of similar positive results as we continue further step-outs along strike and down dip at Noche Buena.”Figure 1: Expansion drilling updateCentral Drill Hole Highlights1Hole IDFrom (m)To (m)Interval (m)ETW (m)2Au (g/t)Ag (g/t)AuEq3Au Cut-off424NB-6767.069.02.01.81.6716.11.881.024NB-67290.6303.012.411.31.7531.92.160.2including297.0299.62.62.37.4295.38.651.024NB-68340.0340.80.80.61.04163.03.151.024NB-68351.1356.15.13.91.725.31.790.2including351.1352.00.90.75.9711.56.121.0including353.7354.91.20.92.501.62.521.024NB-77308.3321.213.011.21.0347.61.650.2including309.8310.50.70.63.3311.03.471.0including316.5317.91.41.21.2887.02.411.0including319.2321.22.01.82.40142.04.241.024NB-78341.4350.69.27.63.1227.73.480.2including342.8346.23.42.87.8064.88.641.0including342.8344.51.71.415.0094.016.221.024NB-78376.2380.94.73.91.0857.71.830.2including377.2379.92.72.21.5788.82.721.0Notes:A complete table of assay results from all deposits and all secondary zones intersected utilizing a 0.20 g/t Au cut-off is on the Company's website.Estimated True Widths (ETW) are estimated based on drill hole geology or comparisons with other on-section drill holes.Au Equivalent (AuEq) grade is calculated as Au g/t + (Ag g/t x ($25.24/$1950)) where $25.24 and $1950 are the price of one ounce of Ag and Au respectively (in US dollars).Composite assay grades presented in summary tables are calculated using a Au grade minimum average of 0.20 g/t or 1.0 g/t as indicated in “Au Cut-off” column of Summary Tables. Maximum internal waste included in any reported composite interval is 3.00 m. The 1.00 g/t Au cut-off is used to define higher-grade “cores” within the lower-grade halo.INTERPRETATIONNoche Buena:24NB-77, -78, -73, and -74, along with previous drilling, now define a 400m long, by 80-160m wide, high-grade shoot at the far southern end of the Central trend. 24NB-78, the southernmost drillhole completed to date at Central, represents an extension of 210m and 300m along strike from the 2024 MRE pit crest and the southernmost 2024 MRE stopes, respectively. The shoot remains open along strike to the south and at depth, and given the high gold and silver grades intercepted, represents a strong opportunity to add additional underground Resources in the Central Trend. Drilling targeting the expansion of this high-grade shoot will continue to be a focus in early 2025.Figure 2: Central Trend drilling updateFigure 3: CentralTrendlong section with drill holes highlighted (A-A’)Figure 4: Central Trend (Noche Buena) cross section B-B’OutlookPrime will continue to evaluate drilling plans using its success-based approach into 2025. This evaluation will also include prioritization of targets based on probability of resource development and generative area discovery potential.Six drill rigs are currently on site at Los Reyes, with exploration focused on:Extending thehigh-grade Z-T Areashoots that remain open at depth, as well as along strike, both north and south.Expanding the knownhigh-grade mineralization at Guadalupe East.Increasing the Central Area resourcethrough additions at Noche Buena and its connection to San Miguel East.Generative target drilling of high-grade interceptsat Las Primas, Mariposa, Fresnillo and others to further develop the resource potential at Los Reyes.Links to Tables:Table 1 –Drill Intercepts in this ReleaseTable 2 –Drill Intercepts to DateAbout the Los Reyes Gold and Silver ProjectLos Reyes is a high-grade, low-sulphidation epithermal gold-silver project located in Sinaloa State, Mexico.

Potential also exists for new discoveries where mineralized trends have been identified outside of the currently defined resource areas. Historic operating results indicate that an estimated 1 million ounces of gold and 60 million ounces of silver were recovered from five separate operations at Los Reyes between 1770 and 1990. Prior to Prime’s acquisition, recent operators of Los Reyes had spent approximately US$20 million on exploration, engineering, and prefeasibility studies.QA/QC Protocols and Sampling ProceduresDrill core at the Los Reyes project is drilled in predominately HQ size (63.5 millimetres “mm”), reducing to NQ (47.6 mm) when required. Drill core samples are generally 1.50 m long along the core axis with allowance for shorter or longer intervals if required to suit geological constraints. After logging intervals are identified to be sampled, the core is cut and one-half is submitted for assay. RC drilling returns rock chips and fines from a 133.35 mm diameter tricone bit. The returns are homogenized and split into 2 halves, with one half submitted for analysis and the other half stored.Sample QA/QC measures include unmarked certified reference materials, blanks, and field duplicates, as well as preparation duplicates inserted into the sample sequence and make up approximately 8% of the samples submitted to the laboratory for each drill hole.Samples are picked up from the Project by the laboratory personnel and transported to their facilities in Durango or Hermosillo Mexico, for sample preparation. Sample analysis is carried out by Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs, with fire assay, including over limits fire assay re-analysis, completed at their respective Hermosillo, Mexico laboratories and multi-element analysis completed in North Vancouver, Canada. Drill core sample preparation includes fine crushing of the sample to at least 70% passing less than 2 mm, sample splitting using a riffle splitter, and pulverizing a 250-gram split to at least 85% passing 75 microns.Gold in diamond drill core is analyzed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy of a 30 g sample (code FA430 or Au-AA23). Multi-element chemistry is analyzed by 4-Acid digestion of a 0.25-gram sample split (code MA300 or ME-ICP61) with detection by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer for a full suite of elements.Gold assay techniques FA430 and Au-AA23 have an upper detection limit of 10 ppm. Any sample that produces an over-limit gold value via the initial assay technique is sent for gravimetric finish via method FA-530 or Au-GRA21. Silver analyses by MA300 and ME-ICP61 have an upper limit of 200 ppm and 100 ppm, respectively. Samples with over-limit silver values are re-analyzed by fire assay with gravimetric finish FA530 or Au-GRA21.Both Bureau Veritas and ALS Labs are ISO/IEC accredited assay laboratories.Additional NotesPrime’s MRE as of October 15, 2024 is classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) “CIM Definition Standards - For Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves” adopted by the CIM Council (as amended, the “CIM Definition Standards”) and in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.Metres is represented by “m”; “etw” is Estimated True Width and is based on drill hole geometry or comparisons with other on-section drill holes; “Au” refers to gold, and “Ag” refers to silver; “g/t” is grams per metric tonne; some figures may not sum due to rounding; Composite assay grades presented in summary tables are calculated using a Au grade minimum average of 0.20 g/t or 1.0 g/t as indicated in “Au Cut-off” column of Summary Tables. Maximum internal waste included in any reported composite interval is 3.00 m. The 1.00 g/t Au cut-off is used to define higher-grade “cores” within the lower-grade halo.Gold equivalent grades are calculated based on an assumed gold price of US$1,950 per ounce and silver price of $25.24 per ounce, based on the formula AuEq grade (g/t) = Au grade + (Ag grade x $25.24 / $1,950). Metallurgical recoveries are not considered in the in-situ grade estimate but are estimated to be 95.6% and 81% for gold and silver, respectively, when processed in a mill, and 73% and 25% respectively when heap-leached.

La Colorada restarted production in early January 2025, and the current drill program is intended to expand the mineral reserves ahead of a Feasibility Study and expansion decision planned for mid-2025.Heliostar CEO, Charles Funk, commented,\"At La Colorada, we are seeing the combined benefit of gold production at record prices and growth from the first significant investment into the project in many years. Our aggressive five-rig drill program is designed to increase the reserves of the Creston pit. Success to date in the shallow part of the pit could lower the upfront capital costs presented in the January 13thTechnical Report. The Company will use the results of this drill program to finalize a Feasibility Study in mid-2025 and then make an expansion decision on La Colorada to 50,000-100,000 ounces per year of annual production. We are also hitting high grades and widths and deeper intercepts could drive underground mining optionality beyond the open pit. We will further test this target with additional drilling in this current drill program.\"Drill Results SummaryMineralization at La Colorada's Creston Pit is predominantly hosted in three veins: the North, Intermediate and South Veins (Figure 1). These veins trend northeast-southwest to east-west, dip northward and are surrounded by halos of smaller mineralized vein zones. The Creston Pit has historically mined oxide gold and silver from all three of these veins. A current Mineral Reserves of 312,000 ounces of gold grading 0.76 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 10.1 g/t silver is defined at the Creston Pit1.Reviewing the expansion potential revealed two opportunities for reserve growth: near surface extensions of known veins where little or no drilling had been completed and upgrading and expanding mineralization beneath the pit. Both opportunities were defined using historical drilling, blasthole data, mining shapes, and the geological model.High-density blast hole data strongly emphasizes the potential for a continuation of veins at shallow depth, defining elevated gold grades that continue to the edge of the pit walls where they remain open for expansion (Figure 1).Figure 1:Plan view of the Creston Pit showing historic drilling, blast hole samples and Heliostar drillholes. Selected intercepts are labelled.Figure 2:Cross-section view of the eastern end of the Creston Pit highlighting the lack of previous drilling beyond the pit boundary. The section shows historic drilling, new Heliostar drillhole results and pit boundary for pit expansion.Forty-seven holes have been completed in the program to date, with results reported for twenty-three new holes in this release. A total of 6,452 metres have been completed to date in the program. The majority of the new drill holes targeted shallow extensions of the North, Intermediate and South Veins in areas considered to be waste in the reserve estimate of the current Technical Report. Additionally, today's results include deeper holes beneath the current pit. These holes target the growth of reserves deeper within the planned pit expansion. They aim to add ounces to the overall El Creston resources and reserves.The results show narrow to wide, low to high-grade oxide gold intercepts. They consistently return intercepts above the 0.16 g/t gold cutoff grade of reserves within the Creston pit. The results suggest that areas of waste could be converted to ore in an updated reserve model.High-grade intercepts deeper in the pit indicate the potential for mineralization that may be amenable to underground mining beyond the current pit boundary. The Company will follow-up on these results to assess the potential to extend mine life with mineralization amenable to underground mining beneath and to the west of the Creston Pit.Next StepsResults from the current drill program will be incorporated into a resource model and support a reserve update to be published with a Feasibility Study in mid-2025.Should the drilling define a material volume of gold mineralization, this program has the potential to reduce the overall strip ratio of the Crestón pit expansion, which could result in a reduction in up-front capital requirements for the restart and improve the economics of the Feasibility Study. This study will be the basis of a decision for the expansion of production at La Colorada in mid-2025.The Company anticipates additional drilling results from the current program will be released in Q1 and Q2, 2025.La Colorada Mineral Reserves StatementClassificationZoneAuEq Cut-off (g/t)Tonnes (kt)Gold Grade(g/t Au)Silver Grade (g/t Ag)Contained Gold(koz)Contained Silver(koz)ProbableEl Crestón0.16012,8410.7610.13124,181Veta Madre0.1751,9050.703.143189La Chatarrera0.1643,4130.206.422704Total18,1590.658.693775,0741La Colorada Operations, Sonora, Mexico, NI 43-101 Technical Report (the \"Report\") is dated January 11, 2024, has an effective date of December 4, 2024Drilling Results TableHoleIDFrom(metres)To(metres)Interval(metres)Au(g/t)Ag(g/t)% TrueWidthComment24-LCDD-238342.4354.011.61.723.789Intermediate Vein24-LCDD-239No significant intervals24-LCDD-240157.0177.0520.050.383.372South Vein24-LCDD-24181.2586.04.750.4915893South Vein24-LCDD-24296.999.52.603.073.755South Vein24-LCDD-24398.2101.353.150.1920.394South Vein24-LCDD-244151.8158.76.902.389.897North Veinand179.2183.54.309.876.898Intermediate Vein179.2183.54.308.886.898Top-cut to 23 g/t gold24-LCDD-24513.4517.253.806.284.3100South Vein13.4517.253.803.954.3100Top-cut to 23 g/t gold24-LCDD-24663.9576.8512.90.3946.493South Vein24-LCDD-24764.067.03.000.245.080South Vein24-LCDD-24866.8573.86.950.181.027South Veinand98.51034.500.663.19South Vein24-LCDD-24955.061.556.550.4439.082South Vein24-LCDD-25016.3522.25.850.163.897Intermediate Veinand45.8553.07.150.224.097South Vein24-LCDD-251263.428521.60.779.093North Veinand439.35454.3515.02.547.589Intermediate Veinand492.45528.4536.00.352.899South Vein24-LCDD-252No significant intervals24-LCDD-25314.521.657.150.221.094Intermediate Veinand31.056.825.80.354.4100South Vein24-LCDD-25435.043.258.250.499.790Intermediate Veinand59.064.05.009.6962.081Intermediate Vein59.064.05.002.8962.081Top-cut to 23 g/t goldand104.4512823.550.538.362Intermediate Vein24-LCDD-25530.639.258.650.283.191South Veinand50.553.052.550.311.498South Vein24-LCDD-256110.95112.651.700.645.776South Vein24-LCDD-257198.45209.511.051.0723.374North Vein24-LCDD-25811.024.013.00.284.072Intermediate Veinand43.2554.911.651.865.571South Vein24-LCDD-25928.9534.45.450.475.223South Veinand104.15116.512.350.936.361South Vein24-LCDD-260No significant intervals24-LCDD-261No significant intervalsTable 1:Significant Drill Intersections.

        "link": "https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1961-tsx-venture/gsvr/174466-guanajuato-silver-files-technical-report-for-el-cubo-mineral-resource-estimate.html",
        "content": "VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESS Newswire / January 30, 2025 /Guanajuato Silver Company Ltd.(the \"Company\" or \"GSilver\")(TSXV:GSVR) (OTCQX:GSVRF) is pleased to announce that a new National Instrument (\"NI\") 43-101 Technical Report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report On The El Cubo And El Pinguico Silver Gold Complex, Guanajuato, Mexico\" and dated effective August 1, 2024 (the \"Report\") has been filed on Sedar atwww.sedarplus.ca. The Report presents a new mineral resource estimate (the \"2024 MRE\") for GSilver's 100% owned El Cubo mine complex (\"El Cubo\") located in Guanajuato, Mexico. (See GSilver news release datedDecember 19, 2024 - Guanajuato Silver Provides New El Cubo Mineral Resource Estimate).Highlights of the ReportInferred mineral resources increased 85% over previous resource estimate* to 35.6 million silver-equivalent9ounces (\"AgEq\").See table below for assumptions regarding the calculation of AgEq.Inferred mineral resource tonnes of 3,711 kt represents a179% increase over the previous resource estimate*.Indicated mineral resources of 3.9M AgEq9; after three years of substantial mining activity at El Cubo, the resources within the Indicated Resource category have declined by just 23% from the previous estimate*.Exploration expansion potential remains high; drilling to convert inferred resources to Indicated Resources commenced in January 2025.The new El Cubo mineral resource estimate is part of a scheduled program to update GSilver's NI 43-101 technical reports and resource estimates for all of its producing mines in Mexico, which includes the El Cubo Mine complex, the Valenciana Mines Complex, and the San Ignacio mine, all located within the state of Guanajuato, and the Topia mine located in northwestern Durango.The 2024 MRE was prepared by APEX Geoscience Ltd. (\"APEX\"), with an effective date of August 1, 2024. The 2024 MRE supersedes and updates the previous mineral resource estimate for the El Cubo mine, disclosed previously by the Company in the technical report entitled \"Technical Report - El Cubo/El Pinguico Silver Gold Complex Project\" with an effective date of December 31, 2023 (the \"Prior Technical Report\")*. The Report replaces the Prior Technical Report as the current NI 43-101 technical report on El Cubo.2024 Mineral Resource EstimateMineralization at El Cubo consists of silver and gold occurring in several stratigraphic formations, with the middle Tertiary La Bufa, Guanajuato, and Calderones formations being the most important hosts. Mineralization at El Cubo is typical of classic high-grade silver-gold banded epithermal vein deposits, with the most productive veins being sub-parallel to the Veta Madre system as north-northwest striking veins and local stockwork style mineralization. Several transverse, northeast striking veins with high-grade gold mineralization also occur. The 2024 MRE includes 44 vein domain models based on underground mapping and sampling, drillhole geological logging, along with the silver and gold assays. The updated El Cubo database now includes a total of 43,919 underground channel samples and 24,602 drillhole samples. Included in these totals, GSilver has collected a total of 26,806 underground channel samples totaling 16,824 m and 4,157 drillhole samples from 129 drillholes since they took over the Project in 2021. As of the Effective Date of the 2024 MRE, the Company has collected a total of 17,402 underground chip channel samples from 4,863 channels, totalling 11,076 m of channel length, that are from the Villalpando and Santa Cecilia areas of El Cubo and are within the mineral estimation domains. A total of 445 drillhole samples collected by the Company are from within the mineral estimation domains.The 2024 MRE comprises Indicated Mineral Resources of 3.9 million troy ounces (Moz) AgEq9at 283.9 g/t AgEq9within 429 thousand tonnes (kt), and Inferred Mineral Resources of 35.6 Moz AgEq9at 298.5 g/t AgEq9within 3,711 kt. Table 1 presents the complete 2024 El Cubo MRE statement.Notes:Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.The author is unaware of any other significant material risks to the 2024 MRE besides the risks inherent to mineral exploration and development. Potential risk factors include changes in metal prices, increases in operating costs, fluctuations in labour costs and availability, availability of investment capital, infrastructure failures, changes in government regulations, community engagement and socio-economic community relations, civil disobedience and protest, permitting and legal challenges, and general environmental concerns. The mining industry in Mexico is also prone to incursions by illegal miners, who gain access to mines or exploration areas to steal mineralized material. These incursions pose a safety, security and financial risk and can potentially compromise underground structures, equipment, and operations.The Inferred Mineral Resource in this estimate has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource could potentially be upgraded to an Indicated Mineral Resource with continued exploration.The 2024 MRE was estimated in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions (2014) and Best Practices Guidelines (2019) prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the CIM Council.The 2024 MRE was completed by Warren Black, M.Sc., P.Geo., Senior Consultant: Mineral Resources with APEX Geoscience Ltd. Mr. Black is the independent Qualified Person (\"QP\"). Tyler Acorn, M.Sc., Senior Geostatistician with APEX completed a peer review.Historically mined areas were removed from the block-modelled Mineral Resources.The 2024 MRE includes the main El Cubo resource area and the El Nayal/Cabrestantes area.Specific gravity of 2.58 g/cm3is used for the 2024 MRE.Economic assumptions used include US$25/oz Ag, US$1,950 /oz Au, process recoveries of 85% for both Ag and Au, a US$15/t processing cost, and a G&A cost of US$15/t. The resulting gold equivalency ratio of Au:Ag ratio was 1:78 and is used for the purposes of the AgEq calculation.The Underground 2024 MRE includes blocks within potential underground mining shapes. A mining cost of US$63/t, in addition to the economic assumptions above, results in an underground AgEq9lower cutoff of 135 g/t. Mining shapes are generated using stope optimization with the objective of maximizing the total metal above the cutoff with a minimum dimension of 1.0 m (W) by 10 m (H) by 20 m (L). All \"take all\" material within the mining shapes is reported, regardless of whether the estimated grades are above the optimized cutoff grade.Mineral Resource Estimate MethodologyAPEX personnel used Ordinary Kriging with locally varying anisotropy to estimate silver and gold grades in a 1.5 m (X) by 1.5 m (Y) by 1.5 m (Z) parent block model. This model is sub-blocked to 0.5 m by 0.5 m by 0.5 m for stope optimization and resource reporting. Kriging considers capped drillhole and underground channel composites.Three types of material were identified during the calculation of the MRE: 1. In Situ, 2. Remnant, and 3. Mined Out. Blocks within, in contact with, or adjacent to underground workings were flagged as Mined Out using a 10 m by 5 m by 1 m search ellipse, aligned along the dip direction of the domain's trend at 0° dip with no third-axis rotation. Blocks within 10 m of the underground workings wireframe in any direction were classified as Remnant material, which is under evaluation but not included in the 2024 MRE. Only In Situ material, unaffected by mining, is included in the 2024 MRE.For Indicated resources, blocks require a minimum of three drillholes within a search ellipse measuring 30 m by 30 m by 15 m. For Inferred resources, blocks need at least one drillhole or underground channel within a search ellipse of 60 m by 50 m by 15 m, based primarily on the second variogram structure. Only channel composites with centroids within the workings wireframe and all core composites are considered for Indicated classification. All channel and composites are considered for Inferred classification.Measured resources are currently not defined. The MRE relies heavily on underground channel samples, often in areas flagged as mined out or remnant, limiting their ability to inform domain locations for in-situ material. Additional underground or surface drilling is needed away from the channel samples to assist in better defining the estimation domains.Sampling and quality assurance/quality controlThe El Cubo underground channel samples were analyzed at Corporación Química Platinum S.A de C.V. (\"QPSV\") in Silao, Guanajuato, until the establishment of the on-site El Cubo laboratory in December 2021. Corporación Química Platinum is independent of GSilver and is accredited by Entidad Mexicana de Acreditación, A.C. (\"EMA\"), which is part of the International Accreditation Forum (\"IAF\"). EMA also works in conjunction with the International Organization for Standardization (\"ISO\") Committee for Conformity Assessment (\"CASCO\"). The El Cubo laboratory remains under GSilver management and is not independent of the Company.Drill core was first reviewed by a Company geologist, who identified and marked intervals for sampling. The marked sample intervals were then cut in half with a diamond saw; half of the core was left in the core box and the other half was removed, placed in plastic bags, sealed and labeled. Intervals and unique sample numbers are recorded on the drill logs and the samples are sequenced with standards and blanks inserted according to a predefined QA/QC procedure. The samples are maintained under security on site until they are shipped to the analytical lab.The El Cubo drill core samples were submitted to QPSV, Silao, Guanajuato, Mexico, for preparation and analysis. To validate assay results and preparation procedures, GSilver systematically sent additional random samples representing approximately 20% of all analytical samples to Bureau Veritas (BV) in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, and approximately 10% of all analytical samples to SGS Mexico, S.A de C.V, Durango, Mexico. BV and SGS are ISO/IEC geo-analytical laboratories and are independent of GSilver.At QPSV and El Cubo laboratory, gold and silver determination was via standard atomic absorption (AA) finish 30-gram fire assay (FA) analysis. Overlimit results were re-run with a gravimetric finish. Multi-element analysis of 33-elements (including silver) of select samples was via multi-acid digestion followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES).At BV and SGS, gold determination was via standard AA finish 30-gram FA analysis.

These assumptions include: the potential quantity, grade and metal content of the mineralized material at El Cubo and San Ignacio, the geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of such material conforming to sampled results and metallurgical performance; available tonnage of mineralized material to be mined and processed; resource grades and recoveries; assumptions and discount rates being appropriately applied to production estimates; prices for silver, gold and other metals remaining as estimated; currency exchange rates remaining as estimated; availability of funds for the Company's projects and to satisfy current liabilities and obligations including debt repayments; capital, decommissioning and reclamation estimates; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation) and inflation rates remaining as estimated; no labour-related disruptions; no unplanned delays or interruptions in scheduled construction and production; all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner; and the ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements and information are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results, level of activity, production levels, performance or achievements of GSilver to differ materially from those expected including, but not limited to, market conditions, availability of financing, currency rate fluctuations, high inflation and interest rates, geopolitical conflicts including wars, actual results of exploration, development and production activities, actual grades and recoveries of silver, gold and other metals from the Company's existing mines including El Cubo, San Ignacio, VMC and Topia, availability of third party mineralized material for processing, unanticipated geological or structural formations and characteristics, environmental risks, future prices of gold, silver and other metals, operating risks, accidents, labor issues, equipment or personnel delays, delays in obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and permits, inadequate insurance, and other risks in the mining industry. There are no assurances that GSilver will be able to continue to increase production, tonnage milled and recoveries rates, improve grades and reduce costs at El Cubo, San Ignacio, VMC and/or Topia to process mineralized materials to produce silver, gold and other concentrates in the amounts, grades, recoveries, costs and timetable anticipated. In addition, GSilver's decision to process mineralized material from El Cubo, San Ignacio, VMC and Topia is not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and therefore is subject to increased uncertainty and risk of failure, both economically and technically. Mineral resources and mineralized material that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability, are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them, and may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, and other relevant issues. There are no assurances that the Company's projected grades of gold and silver at El Cubo and San Ignacio and the anticipated level of production therefrom will be realized. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will meet its production forecasts or generate the anticipated cash flows from operations to satisfy its scheduled debt payments or other liabilities when due or meet financial covenants to which the Company is subject or to fund its exploration programs and corporate initiatives as planned. There is also uncertainty about impact of any resurgence of COVID-19, the ongoing war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza, elevated inflation and interest rates and the impact they will have on the Company's operations, supply chains, ability to access mining projects or procure equipment, contractors and other personnel on a timely basis or at all and economic activity in general.

        "content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --MAG Silver Corp. (TSX / NYSE American: MAG)(“MAG” or “MAG Silver”) reports production from Juanicipio (56% / 44% Fresnillo plc (“Fresnillo”) and MAG, respectively) for the fourth quarter (“Q4”) and year ended December 31, 2024. These results demonstrate strong sustained quarter on quarter operational performance throughout 2024 and reinforce Juanicipio’s position as a world class silver asset.Steady throughput: The Juanicipio plant maintained steady production with 333,612 tonnes of ore processed in Q4, consistent with Q3. All material processed in 2024 was processed through the Juanicipio plant.Solid grade performance: In line with plan, silver head grade averaged 417 grams per tonne (“g/t”) during the quarter delivering a guidance beating 2024 head grade of 468g/t. Both metrics exceeded expectations, reflecting the high quality of the resource.Consistent precious metal recovery: Incremental metallurgical improvements implemented in the first half of the year delivered consistently high precious metal recovery rates which were further supported by ongoing circuit optimisation efforts.Robust production output: Preliminary Q4 production included 4.3 million ounces of silver and 9,041 ounces of gold. For the full year, Juanicipio produced a total of 18.6 million ounces of silver and 39,029 ounces of gold, marking a 10.5% and 6.3% year-over-year increase, respectively.Guidance beat: Enhanced grades and higher recovery delivered silver production exceeding the top end of revised production guidance by 1.3 million ounces reinforcing confidence in Juanicipio’s long-term potential.Production highlights (100% basis):Q4 2024Q3 2024% ChgQ4 2023*% Chg20242023*% ChgMillingt333,612332,2900.4%346,766-3.8%1,328,1781,268,7574.7%Head gradeSilverg/t417481-13.3%467-10.7%468472-0.8%Goldg/t1.151.32-12.9%1.37-16.1%1.251.27-1.6%Lead%1.491.58-5.7%1.3510.4%1.501.1530.4%Zinc%2.792.83-1.4%2.4414.3%2.782.0635.0%ProductionSilverkoz4,2574,886-12.9%4,505-5.5%18,57116,81210.5%Goldoz9,04110,801-16.3%10,591-14.6%39,02936,7296.3%Lead1klb9,88110,656-7.3%9,1897.5%39,19928,35138.3%Zinc2klb15,63316,757-6.7%15,0863.6%65,89144,75447.2%* Includes material processed at the Fresnillo, Saucito and Juanicipio beneficiation plants.1Lead recovered to lead concentrate.2Zinc recovered to zinc concentrate.2025 GuidanceAs reported by Fresnillo, silver production at Juanicipio is forecast to range between 14.7 million and 16.7 million ounces. This guidance is based on a throughput rate of 4,000 tonnes per operating day at head grade ranges of 380g/t to 430 g/t silver and 1.2 g/t to 1.4g/t gold. Head grades are anticipated to fluctuate due to the balancing of the three subvertical ramps and the mining of different sections of the orebody. Production is expected to be weighted toward the second and third quarters of 2025, reflecting mine sequencing and anticipated grade variability. Comprehensive cost and production guidance will be provided with the release of the Company’s operational and financial results at the end of Q1 2025.“Delivering silver production of nearly 19 million ounces in 2024 is a testament to the quality and resilience of the Juanicipio project and the quality of the team’s execution,”said George Paspalas, MAG Silver’s President and CEO.“Consistently strong grades and reliable recoveries have laid the foundation for sustained performance and positioned us to continue unlocking value in the years ahead. While guidance reflects expected variability in grades and production rates due to mine sequencing, it underscores the sustainable operation we have built at Juanicipio. We remain focused, together with Fresnillo, on delivering consistent performance, optimizing costs, and driving value creation for all our stakeholders.”Qualified PersonAll scientific or technical information in this press release is based upon information prepared by or under the supervision of, or has been approved by Gary Methven, P.Eng., who is a “Qualified Person” for purposes of National Instrument 43-101,Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects(“National Instrument 43-101” or “NI 43-101”).

        "content": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - January 29, 2025) -Bear Creek Mining Corporation(TSXV: BCM) (OTCQX: BCEKF) (BVL: BCM) (\"Bear Creek\" or the \"Company\") announces updated estimates of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves for the Mercedes Mine, located in Sonora Mexico, effective September 30, 2024 (the \"2024 Estimates\").Key Findings of the 2024 Estimates(1) (2) (3)Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves of 0.43 million tonnes grading 3.95 grams per tonne (\"gpt\") gold and 22.71 gpt silver, for a total of 54.3 thousand troy ounces (\"ounces\") of gold and 312.5 thousand ounces of silver.Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 2.34 million tonnes grading 5.98 gpt gold and 52.12 gpt silver, for a total of 449.7 thousand ounces of gold and 3.9 million ounces of silver.Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.38 million tonnes grading 5.26 gpt gold and 36.06 gpt silver, for a total of 64.9 thousand ounces of gold and 444.6 thousand ounces of silver.Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources at Mercedes have decreased since last calculated as of December 31, 2021 (the \"2021 Estimates\") due to depletion in several deposit areas, increased operating costs, higher dilution, and inaccessible regions within the mine. The 2021 Estimates were outlined in the Technical Report (as defined in National Instrument 43-101) entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mercedes Gold-Silver Mine, Sonora State, Mexico\" dated July 4, 2022 with an effective date of December 31, 2021.The 2024 Mineral Resource estimates indicate that the Mercedes Mine life has the potential to be extended, and recent brownfield and greenfield exploration targeting efforts support the Company's belief that the Mercedes district has substantial opportunity for the discovery of additional mineralization.(1) Mineral Resources presented herein are inclusive of Mineral Reserves.(2) Details and key assumptions related to the Mineral Resource Estimation and Mineral Reserve Calculation are provided below.(3) There is no evidence at present, nor can there be any assurances, that any portion of the 2024 Mineral Resources will be converted in the future to Mineral Reserves or that the Mercedes Mine life will be extended beyond production anticipated from the 2024 Mineral Reserves.Eric Caba, President and CEO, comments, \"Starting from the ground up, Bear Creek has reworked the geological and block models it inherited at Mercedes and validated the outcome with external experts. Although Reserves have been lost as a result of the updated models, the application of more realistic development costs, the sterilization of some areas of mineralization, and higher operating costs as we switch mining methodologies, we now have a robust model based on real world costs to work with going forward. Given Mercedes' long history of converting Resources to Reserves, we anticipate that as drilling and development continue, much of the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources will be converted to Reserves. I am also excited about the number and quality of near mine exploration targets that have been identified in recent months and look forward to being able to test these targets with an aggressive exploration initiative in 2025 focused on increasing Mercedes' Mineral Reserves and Resources, which we will highlight in an exploration update in the coming weeks.\"The 2024 Mineral Resource estimate was prepared by the Company and reviewed, audited and validated by Global Resource Engineering Ltd (\"GRE\") and the 2024 Mineral Reserve estimate was prepared by GRE, based on conversion parameters provided by the Company. The 2024 Estimates presented herein will be supported by an updated Technical Report for the Mercedes Mine to be filed with the appropriate regulatory agencies within 45 days of the date of this news release.2024 Mineral Resource Estimate2024 Mineral Resources(1), Mercedes Mine (effective September 30, 2024)ClassificationTonnesAu (gpt)Ag (gpt)Contained Au(troy ounces)Contained Ag(troy ounces)Measured792,5696.6258.10168,5751,480,539Indicated1,546,4845.6549.06281,1022,439,101Measured + Indicated2,339,0535.9852.12449,6773,919,640Inferred383,4175.2636.0664,884444,563Total2,722,4705.8849.86514,5614,364,203(1) 2024 Mineral Resources are inclusive of the 2024 Mineral Reserves presented belowThe 2024 Mineral Resource estimate is comprised of ten deposit areas: Barrancas, Diluvio, Gap, Klondike, Lagunas, Lupita, Marianas, San Martin, Rey de Oro and Rey de Oro Hill (see Figure 1, below). Small amounts of peripheral mineralized extensions from four additional deposit areas representing historic mine workings (Aida, Brecha Hill, Casa Blanca and Corona de Oro), previously included in the 2021 Estimates, have been re-categorized as condemned materials and are excluded from the 2024 Mineral Resources summarized above. These areas are currently, and for the foreseeable future, being backfilled with low strength paste. The 2024 Mineral Resources, based on an appropriate cut-off gold grade for each deposit area included in the tabulation, consider different mining extraction scenarios and processing recoveries. The cut-off grades for the various deposits included in the 2024 Mineral Resource vary from 2.1 to 3.0 gpt gold.The 2024 Mineral Resources were reviewed and validated by GRE based on their review of the Mercedes database, the new geological model, and the Mineral Resource block model including the classification of resources based on drill spacing and geological and grade continuity. GRE reported that the Mineral Resource Estimate block models conform to industry standard practices and show a good correlation with the extensive drill hole database.2024 Mineral Reserve Calculation2024 Mineral Reserves, Mercedes Mine (effective September 30, 2024)ClassificationOre TonnesAu (gpt)Ag (gpt)Contained Au(troy ounces)Contained Ag (troy ounces)Proven9,3924.2524.671,2827,448Probable418,5843.9422.6753,009305,048Total427,9763.9522.7154,291312,496The 2024 Mineral Reserve Calculation comprises five deposit areas: Marianas, Barrancas, Gap, Rey de Oro and Rey de Oro Hill (see Figure 1, below).Considering relevant mining methods, underground mine designs were created by the Company to determine economic zones for extraction. The mine designs were reviewed and verified by GRE and modified to remove certain areas based on various mining considerations including dilution, likelihood of extraction, recovery factors and stope economics, and taking into account updated operational costs and cut-off grades. Areas with a reasonable expectation for economic extraction were comprised to form the 2024 Mineral Reserves tabulated above.Planned and unplanned dilution factors were estimated for each Mercedes deposit. Planned dilution includes material required to be excavated for minimum mining widths (3.5 meters) or to address geo-mechanical or geometrical constraints. Capital development costs and operating development costs were estimated to be $4,320 per meter and $2,853 per meter, respectively. Cut-off grades were estimated for each deposit area based on break-even feed grades taking into consideration the mining method and costs specific to each deposit, and processing costs, general and administrative costs, gold price, gold recovery and refinery costs. GRE used the estimated cut-off grade for each deposit to calculate respective Net Smelter Revenue (\"NSR\") cut-offs. which were then used to calculate the 2024 Mineral Reserves presented above.Credits related to revenue from silver extraction were not included as historically the low silver mill recovery at Mercedes does not represent significant value.Factors Impacting 2024 EstimatesThe 2024 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates were impacted primarily by the following factors that occurred since preparation of the 2021 Estimates (the \"Intervening Period\"):Significantly improved metal price estimates.Depletion of ore as a result of production of 127,108 ounces of gold (1.3 million tonnes at an average gold grade of 3.08 gpt) during the Intervening Period.The removal of areas of mineralization contained within inner ribs and crown pillars and from deposits now deemed inaccessible or uneconomic due to development requirements.A reduction in economically minable ore due to higher operating and processing costs, higher development costs, increased estimated dilution and lower recovery estimates.Infill drilling at the Mercedes Mine during the Intervening Period added approximately 0.98 million tonnes grading 3.31 gpt gold (representing approximately 104 thousand ounces of gold) to Mineral Resources. Any new Mineral Reserves created during the Intervening Period as a result of this infill drilling were mined prior to the 2024 Mineral Reserve effective date.The reduction in both Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves at the Mercedes Mine during the Intervening Period is substantial and is likely to negatively impact the carrying value of the Mercedes Mine as at December 31, 2024.On behalf of the Board of Directors,Eric CabaPresident and CEOFor further information contact:Barbara Henderson - VP Corporate CommunicationsDirect: 604-628-1111E-mail:This email address is being protected from spambots.

        "content": "All amounts are in United States dollars, unless otherwise stated.TORONTO, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Alamos Gold Inc.(TSX:AGI; NYSE:AGI) (“Alamos” or the “Company”) today announced it has been granted approval of an amendment to its existing environmental impact assessment (Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental “MIA\") by Mexico’s Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (“SEMARNAT”), allowing for the start of construction on the Puerto Del Aire (“PDA”) project located within the Mulatos District.“Mulatos is our founding operation and a steady producer since 2005. Through a long-track record of exploration success, we have discovered and developed a number of high-return projects that have continued to extend the mine life of the Mulatos District. Having achieved this key permitting milestone through long-standing community, state, and federal government support, PDA is expected to significantly extend the mine life of the District, as our next high-return project with significant exploration upside. With an initial Mineral Reserve and Resource declared on PDA at the end of 2021, the transition from discovery to construction has been rapid and exemplifies the exploration upside within the District,” said John A. McCluskey, President and Chief Executive Officer.As outlined earlier this month, construction activities on PDA are expected to begin ramping up toward the middle of 2025. Capital spending on PDA is expected to total $37 to $40 million in 2025 to advance underground development and procurement of mill long lead time items. The remainder of the total initial capital estimate of $165 million will be spent in 2026 and 2027 with first production anticipated mid-2027.PDA is a higher-grade underground deposit located adjacent to the main Mulatos pit. The results of a positive internal economic study were announced in September 2024 and highlighted an attractive, low-cost, high-return project. Annual gold production is expected to average 127,000 ounces over the first four years, and 104,000 ounces over an eight-year mine life based on Mineral Reserves at the end of 2023. Mine-site all-in sustaining costs are expected to average $1,003 per payable ounce.Combined with a low capital intensity, PDA has an estimated after-tax Net Present Value (“NPV”) (5%) of $269 million, and after-tax Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) of 46%, using a base case gold price of $1,950 per ounce and MXN/USD foreign exchange rate of 18:1. At a $2,500 per ounce gold price, PDA has an estimated after-tax NPV (5%) of $492 million and an after-tax IRR of 73%.The project contains significant exploration upside with PDA open in multiple directions and higher grade mineralization intersected below the past producing Cerro Pelon open pit. This is expected to support an initial underground Mineral Resource at Cerro Pelon with the 2024 year-end update to be released in February 2025. Cerro Pelon represents upside as a potential source of additional feed to the PDA sulphide mill that could extend the higher rates of production beyond the first four years of the current mine plan.About AlamosAlamos is a Canadian-based intermediate gold producer with diversified production from three operations in North America.

Unless otherwise indicated, all Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates included in this document have been prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the “CIM”) - CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the “CIM Standards”). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators, which established standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Mining disclosure in the United States was previously required to comply with SEC Industry Guide 7 (“SEC Industry Guide 7”) under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has adopted final rules, to replace SEC Industry Guide 7 with new mining disclosure rules under sub-part 1300 of Regulation S-K of the U.S. Securities Act (“Regulation S-K 1300”) which became mandatory for U.S. reporting companies beginning with the first fiscal year commencing on or after January 1, 2021. Under Regulation S-K 1300, the SEC now recognizes estimates of “Measured Mineral Resources”, “Indicated Mineral Resources” and “Inferred Mineral Resources”. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of “Proven Mineral Reserves” and “Probable Mineral Reserves” to be substantially similar to international standards.Investors are cautioned that while the above terms are “substantially similar” to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions under Regulation S-K 1300 and the CIM Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as “proven mineral reserves”, “probable mineral reserves”, “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources” under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates under the standards adopted under Regulation S-K 1300. U.S. investors are also cautioned that while the SEC recognizes “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources” under Regulation S-K 1300, investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater degree of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable.Cautionary Note Regarding non-GAAP Measures and Additional GAAP MeasuresNote that for purposes of this section, GAAP refers to IFRS. The Company believes that investors use certain non-GAAP and additional GAAP measures as indicators to assess gold mining companies. They are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared with GAAP.“Cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital” is a non-GAAP performance measure that could provide an indication of the Company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations and is calculated by adding back the change in non-cash working capital to “cash provided by (used in) operating activities” as presented on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. “Cash flow per share” is calculated by dividing “cash flow from operations before changes in working capital” by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. “Free cash flow” is a non-GAAP performance measure that is calculated as cash flows from operations net of cash flows invested in mineral property, plant and equipment and exploration and evaluation assets as presented on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows and that would provide an indication of the Company’s ability to generate cash flows from its mineral projects. “Mine site free cash flow” is a non-GAAP measure which includes cash flow from operating activities at, less capital expenditures at each mine site. “Return on equity” is defined as earnings from continuing operations divided by the average total equity for the current and previous year. “Mining cost per tonne of ore” and “cost per tonne of ore” are non-GAAP performance measures that could provide an indication of the mining and processing efficiency and effectiveness of the mine. These measures are calculated by dividing the relevant mining and processing costs and total costs by the tonnes of ore processed in the period. “Cost per tonne of ore” is usually affected by operating efficiencies and waste-to-ore ratios in the period. “Total capital expenditures per ounce produced” is a non-GAAP term used to assess the level of capital intensity of a project and is calculated by taking the total growth and sustaining capital of a project divided by ounces produced life of mine. “Total cash costs per ounce”, “all-in sustaining costs per ounce”, “mine-site all-in sustaining costs”, and “all-in costs per ounce” as used in this analysis are non-GAAP terms typically used by gold mining companies to assess the level of gross margin available to the Company by subtracting these costs from the unit price realized during the period. These non-GAAP terms are also used to assess the ability of a mining company to generate cash flow from operations. There may be some variation in the method of computation of these metrics as determined by the Company compared with other mining companies. In this context, “total cash costs” reflects mining and processing costs allocated from in-process and doré inventory and associated royalties with ounces of gold sold in the period. Total cash costs per ounce are exclusive of exploration costs. “All-in sustaining costs per ounce” include total cash costs, exploration, corporate and administrative, share based compensation and sustaining capital costs. “Mine-site all-in sustaining costs” include total cash costs, exploration, and sustaining capital costs for the mine-site, but exclude an allocation of corporate and administrative and share based compensation. “Adjusted net earnings” and “adjusted earnings per share” are non-GAAP financial measures with no standard meaning under IFRS. “Adjusted net earnings” excludes the following from net earnings: foreign exchange gain (loss), items included in other loss, certain non-reoccurring items, and foreign exchange gain (loss) recorded in deferred tax expense. “Adjusted earnings per share” is calculated by dividing “adjusted net earnings” by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.Additional GAAP measures that are presented on the face of the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are not meant to be a substitute for other subtotals or totals presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such IFRS measures. This includes “Earnings from operations”, which is intended to provide an indication of the Company’s operating performance and represents the amount of earnings before net finance income/expense, foreign exchange gain/loss, other income/loss, and income tax expense. Non-GAAP and additional GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of historical non-GAAP and additional GAAP measures are detailed in the Company’s latest Management’s Discussion and Analysis available online on the SEDAR+ website atwww.sedarplus.caor on EDGAR atwww.sec.govand atwww.alamosgold.com."

        "content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --Xali Gold Corp.(TSXV:XGC) (“Xali Gold” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that a Definitive Agreement (the “Agreement”) has been agreed to with Remedioambiente S.A. de C.V. (“Remedioambiente”) allowing them to start underground test work at El Oro, Mexico. The initial work will focus on identifying the most effective recovery methods for gold and silver as well as establishing the best underground access. Xali Gold is to be paid a Net Smelter Return (“NSR”) of approximately 3% on all gold and silver recovered by Remedioambiente from the historic workings above the 2400 metre (“m”) level.“We are very pleased to have the underground work commencing at El Oro. The Remedioambiente team has an impressive track record of achieving production rapidly, delivering strong profits, and uncovering valuable mineral deposits. Our Agreement with them not only preserves the exploration potential we’ve identified below the historic workings but also paves the way for collaborative testing of exploration concepts, underground access for drilling our previously defined high-grade targets under the historic workings, and the opportunity to get up to date on mineral rights fees,” states Joanne Freeze, President and CEO of Xali Gold.The Agreement supercedes the binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) datedJuly 22, 2024and provides for an initial term of 5 years which may be extended for an additional 5 years providing Remedioambiente is spending a minimum US$1 Million (“M”) per year on the property. Xali Gold retains the exclusive ownership of all mineral bodies discovered or delineated below the 2400 m level.In addition, Remedioambiente shall maintain the concessions in good standing, by paying the semi-annual concession fees, by incurring the minimum investments and the corresponding filings with the Mexican Mines Bureau, by filing statistical reports and by paying the Governmental Royalties.About RemedioambienteRemedioambiente is a private company controlled and managed by Keith Piggott, the former President and CEO of Goldgroup Mining Inc. and Core Gold Inc. Mr. Piggott is a mining engineer with over 50 years of experience in Zambia, Australia and PNG, Mexico and South America. As well as significant exploration success in the recent past, he has started 3 mines: Cerro Colorado, El Boludo and Cerro Prieto in Sonora, Mexico plus a green-fields start in a record time of 3 months in Ecuador. These mines have collectively produced approximately 500,000 oz of gold to date.Other MattersWhile expecting an update on test work on the El Oro Tailings project and increased activity at the SDA beneficiation plant in Western Mexico, Xali Gold continues to review opportunities for increasing exploration including other potential high grade gold-silver vein targets in Mexico and low cost production style high sulphidation gold-silver projects in Peru.About Xali GoldXali Gold has gold and silver projects in Peru and Mexico. The Company’s flagship project, El Oro, is a district scale historic producer of 8 million gold equivalent ounces of gold and silver. Future exploration in Mexico will be focused on the El Oro property which covers 20 veins with past production and more than 57 veins in total, from which approximately 6.4M ozs of gold and 74M ozs of silver were reported to have been produced from just two of these veins (Ref. Mexico Geological Service Bulletin Nr. 37, Mining of the El Oro and Tlalpujahua Districts, by T. Flores in 1920). Modern understanding of epithermal vein systems indicates that several of the El Oro district’s veins hold excellent discovery potential, particularly below and adjacent to the historic workings of the San Rafael Vein, which was mined to an average depth of only 200m.While the Company’s main goal at El Oro is to make a new discovery, similar to the multi-million ounce (“oz”) gold and silver ore bodies mined historically, the Company has entered into two agreements to bring in cash flow by producing gold and silver from the El Oro Project. Kappes, Cassiday & Associates (“KCA”), in partnership with Starcore International Mines Ltd., has the right to reprocess tailings which contain 1.27 million tonnes at a grade of 2.94 gpt gold and 75.12 gpt silver (3.85 gpt gold equivalent) containing 119,900 oz of gold and 3,061,200 oz of silver*. Remedioambiente S.A. de C.V. (“RM”) has the right to recover gold and silver from mineralized veins and backfill left behind in the historic mine workings as described above. The agreements provide for Xali Gold to receive funds from net smelter returns (“NSRs”) of up to 3% from each of these two agreements.Xali Gold is dedicated to being a responsible community partner.Joanne C. Freeze, P.Geo., President and CEO is the Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 for the projects discussed above. Ms. Freeze has reviewed and approved the contents of this release.

        "content": "VANCOUVER, BC,Jan. 28, 2025/CNW/ -Vizsla Silver Corp.(TSXV: VZLA) (NYSE: VZLA) (Frankfurt: 0G3) (\"Vizsla Silver\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide a year-end summary of its activities at its flagshipPanucosilver-gold property (the \"Property\" or \"Panuco\") located inSinaloa, Mexicoand outline the Company's key objectives/milestones for 2025.\"2024 was a transformative year for Vizsla Silver,\" commentedMichael Konnert, President & CEO. \"With an updated resource estimate inJanuary 2024serving as the backbone for the first ever Panuco PEA, published in July, Vizsla Silver went from early-stage exploration to early-stage development. Our focus throughout the year was on derisking known mineralization within theCopalaand Napoleon resource areas to maximize potential future economic returns. The July PEA showcased industry leading economics based on conservative assumptions and a resource base that has since been materially upgraded and expanded. We now have 43% more ounces in the measured and indicated category and higher grades, relative to the previous resource. This bodes well for a potentially expanded mine plan in the pending feasibility study we plan to publish in the second half of 2025. Additionally, we have broken ground on our fully permitted and fully fundedCopalatest mine, arguably one of the most valuable derisking initiatives for the project. This will support feasibility study mine planning and development as we advance Panuco Project 1 (\"Project 1\" or \"Panuco Project 1\") to construction. With overUS$92 millionin cash and no debt, we remain well funded to deliver on our operational goals with a long-term view of first silver in 2027. In 2025, we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our communities and team members as we advance through the permitting and development process. Beyond development in the West, we continue exploring new areas of the district with both low-cost mapping and geophysical surveys and +10,000 meters of planned initial drilling.

Gold and silver metallurgical recoveries used in this release are from metallurgical test results of the Copala vein (see press release dated August 16, 2023)2025 OutlookVizsla Silver's focus for 2025 remains centered on de-risking Project 1 in the west with a goal of first silver in 2027. To achieve this, the Company is actively working to complete a Feasibility Study, while simultaneously advancing permitting and project financing to support a construction decision. In parallel, Vizsla Silver will continue exploring other prospective areas in the western portion of the district, proximal to Project 1, but also in the central and eastern areas, where exploration drilling completed to date remains sparse. Key de-risking initiatives planned for 2025 include:1)Advance test Mine2)Advance Permitting/Project Finance3)Deliver FSFor 2025, a total of +37,000 metres of drilling is planned for Engineering (FS studies), expansion, and exploration programs. Two diamond drill rigs will be active on the property, with the ability to scale up depending on exploration success. Exploration drills will focus on priority targets proximal to current resources in the west, as well as on other high-priority targets in the central and eastern portions of the district.TargetsResource Extension:TheCopalastructure remains open along strike to the north and down dip to the south. Alternatively, after the discovery of the oldCopalaadit and concomitant with the successful infill/expansion drilling campaign in centralCopala, the team identified potential for near surface high-grade mineralization in the south. Vizsla Silver intends to drill two near surface targets in the second half (H2) of 2025 once the team completes detailed structural and alteration mapping alongCopala, south of the old adit.At Napoleon area, the company plans to conduct resource expansion drilling along the hanging wall-4 vein (HW4) down-dip to the east and along the400mwide gap in La Luisa vein (see press release datedFebruary 13, 2024), between the current mineral resource area and the shallow drill-holes located500mto the north.Exploration:During the first half (H1) of 2025 Vizsla Silver will continue drill-testing the Camelia-San Dimas,Galeanaand San Fernando-Nacaral targets in the northeast part of the district. Other targets such asEl Roble, Oregano and La Whicha, also in the northeast will be explored in H2.The Company also plans to drill additional exploration holes atEl Molino(see press release datedOctober 24, 2023) and at the convergence zone of main Napoleon vein withLa Coloradavein –Copalafault system in north Napoleon area. Exploration drilling on the north Napoleon area is planned for H2 after completion of the ground EM survey.Mapping / GeophysicsThe Company continues advancing detailed mapping at 1:1000 scale throughout the district; +67% of Panuco district has been mapped to date with the aid of LiDar, WorldView III and Aster satellite imagery and Terraspec analyses. Company geologists also started 3D interpretations of Terraspec data collected on core samples to further build 3D alteration models and define drilling vectors.Vizsla Silver also contracted TMC Geophysical consulting to conduct a Horizontal Loop EM (Promis-HLEM) survey on 45 l-km overCopalaand 5 selected high-priority targets during Q1. The objective of this study is to determine the geophysical response of known mineralization near-surface atCopala, and then investigate five other selected targets in the district.Key objectives for 2025AdvanceCopalatest mine development and bulk sample programComplete fourth round of metallurgical testing in H1 2025Advance through permitting processDeliver Feasibility Study in H2 2025Complete +12,000 meters of geotechnical drilling to support the FSComplete +25,000 meters of ongoing discovery-based and resource expansion drillingComplete a ~45 line-kilometre ground Horizontal-Loop EM (Promis-HLEM) over six selected target areasAbout the Panuco ProjectThe newly consolidatedPanucosilver-gold project is an emerging high-grade discovery located in southernSinaloa, Mexico, near the city of Mazatlán. The 7,189.5-hectare, past producing district benefits from over 86 kilometres of total vein extent, 35 kilometres of underground mines, roads, power, and permits.The district contains intermediate to low sulfidation epithermal silver and gold deposits related to siliceous volcanism and crustal extension in the Oligocene and Miocene. Host rocks are mainly continental volcanic rocks correlated to the Tarahumara Formation.OnJanuary 6, 2025, the Company announced an updated mineral resource estimate forPanucowhich includes an estimated in-situ combined measured and indicated mineral resource of 222.4 Moz AgEq and an in-situ inferred resource of 138.7 Moz AgEq (please refer to Vizsla Silver's press release datedJanuary 6, 2025).About Vizsla SilverVizsla Silver is a Canadian mineral exploration and development company headquartered inVancouver, BC, focused on advancing its flagship, 100%-ownedPanucosilver-gold project located inSinaloa, Mexico. The Company recently completed a Preliminary Economic Study forPanucoinJuly 2024which highlights 15.2 Moz AgEq of annual production over an initial 10.6-year mine life, an after-tax NPV5% ofUS$1.1B, 86% IRR and a 9-month payback atUS$26/oz Ag andUS$1,975/oz Au. Vizsla Silver aims to become the world's leading silver company by implementing a dual track development approach atPanuco, advancing mine development, while continuing district scale exploration through low-cost means.Quality Assurance / Quality ControlDrill core samples were shipped to ALS Limited inZacatecas,Zacatecas, Mexicoand inNorth Vancouver, Canadafor sample preparation and for analysis at the ALS laboratory inNorth Vancouverand rock samples were shipped to SGS Lab inDurango Mexicofor sample preparation and analysis.  The ALS Zacatecas,North Vancouverfacilities and SGS lab are ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 17025 certified. Silver and base metals were analyzed using a four-acid digestion with an ICP finish and gold was assayed by 30-gram fire assay with atomic absorption (\"AA\") spectroscopy finish. Over limit analyses for silver, lead and zinc were re-assayed using an ore-grade four-acid digestion with AA finish.Control samples comprising certified reference samples, duplicates and blank samples were systematically inserted into the sample stream and analyzed as part of the Company's quality assurance / quality control protocol.Qualified PersonIn accordance with NI 43-101,Jesus Velador, Ph.D. MMSA QP, Vice President of Exploration, is the Qualified Person for the Company and has reviewed and approved the technical and scientific content of this news release.Information Concerning Estimates of Mineral ResourcesThe scientific and technical information in this news release was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 which differs significantly from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The terms \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" used herein are in reference to the mining terms defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards (the \"CIM Definition Standards\"), which definitions have been adopted by NI 43-101. Accordingly, information contained herein providing descriptions of our mineral deposits in accordance with NI 43-101 may not be comparable to similar information made public by other U.S. companies subject tothe United Statesfederal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.You are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral resources will ever be converted into reserves. Pursuant to CIM Definition Standards, \"inferred mineral resources\" are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Such geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve. However, it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.Canadian standards, including the CIM Definition Standards and NI 43-101, differ significantly from standards in the SEC Industry Guide 7. EffectiveFebruary 25, 2019, the SEC adopted new mining disclosure rules under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\"), with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or afterJanuary 1, 2021. The SEC Modernization Rules replace the historical property disclosure requirements included in SEC Industry Guide 7. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\". Information regarding mineral resources contained or referenced herein may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies that report according to U.S. standards. While the SEC Modernization Rules are purported to be \"substantially similar\" to the CIM Definition Standards, readers are cautioned that there are differences between the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definitions Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that the Company may report as \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules.Website:www.vizslasilvercorp.caSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis news release includes certain \"Forward–Looking Statements\" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and \"forward–looking information\" under applicable Canadian securities laws.

(NYSE: MUX) (TSX: MUX)is pleased to report full-year 2024 consolidated production of135,900gold equivalent ounces (“GEOs”)(1), within our guidance range for the year (press release datedFeb 12, 2024).During 2024, Gold Bar and San Jose produced 44,600 and 60,100 GEOs, respectively, slightly exceeding the top end of our guidance ranges for those operations. At the Fox Complex, we produced 30,150 GEOs, which was below annual guidance due to a stope failure in early 2024 impacting production.Table 1:Consolidated 2024 Production and 2025 Guidance SummaryFull Year2024(3)(4)2024Guidance(4)2025GuidanceConsolidated ProductionGEOs(1)135,900130,000 - 145,000120,000 - 140,000Cash Costs/GEO$1,550 - $1,750AISC/GEO$1,800 - $2,000Gold Bar Mine, NevadaGEOs44,60040,000 - 43,00040,000 - 45,000Cash Costs/GEO$1,500 - $1,700AISC/GEO$1,700 - $1,900Fox Complex, CanadaGEOs30,15040,000 - 42,00030,000 - 35,000Cash Costs/GEO$1,600 - $1,800AISC/GEO$1,700 - $1,900San José Mine, Argentina (49%)(2)GEOs60,10050,000 - 60,00050,000 - 60,000Cash Costs/GEO$1,600 - $1,800AISC/GEO$1,900 - $2,1002025 Production and Cost GuidanceFor 2025, we expect consolidated production to be between120,000 and 140,000 GEOsattributable to MUX from all operations. The lower end of the 2025 range is driven by the planned transition of production at the Fox Complex from the Froome mine to the Stock mine in late 2025.At Fox in 2025, due to permitting delays, the development of the ramp access to the Stock project is expected to continue through the majority of the year, with commercial production from Stock now expected in early 2026. Operations at the Froome mine will wind down in late 2025. The capital investment required for ramp development in 2025 has been partially funded by the US$22.0 million flow-through financing completed in June 2024.At Gold Bar in 2025, the first half of the year is expected to deliver lower production relative to the second half, due to a scheduled continuation of high waste stripping in the Pick pit to be completed during 2025. The investment in waste stripping at the Pick pit is expected to improve ore availability during the second half of 2025 and through 2026, increasing future annual gold production.Notes:(1)'Gold Equivalent Ounces' are calculated based on a gold-to-silver price ratio of 89:1 for Q1 2024, 81:1 for Q2 2024, 85:1 for Q3 2024, and 85:1 for Q4 2024. 2025 production guidance is calculated based on an 86:1 gold-to-silver price ratio.(2)The San José Mine is 49% owned by McEwen Mining Inc. and 51% owned and operated by Hochschild Mining plc. Production is shown on a 49% basis.(3)El Gallo Mine (on care and maintenance) sold 1,052 ounces in FY2024 from plant and pond cleanout.(4)Full Year 2024 costs and their comparison against 2024 Guidance will be published in a future press release on our 2024 audited annual results.(5)Cash costs and AISC per GEO sold are presented in U.S. Dollars for all operations.Technical InformationThe technical content of this news release related to financial results, mining and development projects has been reviewed and approved by William (Bill) Shaver, P.Eng., COO of McEwen Mining and a Qualified Person as defined by SEC S-K 1300 and the Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 \"Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.\"Reliability of Information Regarding San JoséMinera Santa Cruz S.A., the owner of the San José Mine, is responsible for and has supplied the Company with all reported results from the San José Mine.

        "content": "Dieppe, New Brunswick--(Newsfile Corp. - January 28, 2025) -Colibri Resource Corporation(TSXV: CBI) (\"Colibri\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to share an update with its shareholders and interested parties in regard to its up to 1,250 metre diamond drilling program presently underway at its jointly held El Pilar Gold & Silver Project in Sonora Mexico. Colibri holds 49% interest of the El Pilar along side its partner Tocvan Ventures, which holds 51% ownership.Drilling UpdateSix holes have now been completed totalling 672.2 metres and a seventh hole is presently underway. Cores from the first several holes have been logged and are presently being prepared to be shipped for geochemical analysis. The Company will report results in due course upon review of the data.On January 22nd, 2025, Tocvan Ventures reported the following in regard to the first four diamond drill holes completed in our 2025 program at Pilar:\"The aim of the core program is to build out a more robust geological model across the area. Each hole completed has successfully intersected lithologies and structures (vein zones, breccia zones and/or large fault gouges) known to host and control gold - silver mineralization at Pilar that will aid in modelling. The Company cautions these are visual indications; assay results are pending to verify the grade of mineralization.\"Ian McGavney, President & CEO of Colibri states, \"The Company is excited to move forward with its partner Tocvan Ventures to unlock Pilar's significant potential. The new data derived from this diamond core drilling program will be added to the project's geological model as well as to an upcoming Maiden Resource Estimate. We look forward to updating our shareholders on these drill results and our other progress at Pilar as we move towards our goal of being a near term gold & silver producer.\"About the Pilar propertyThe Pilar gold-silver property has returned some of the region's best drill results. Coupled with encouraging gold and silver recovery results from metallurgical test work, Pilar is primed to be a potential near-term producer. The project is interpreted as a structurally controlled low-sulphidation epithermal system hosted in andesite rock. Initially, three primary zones of mineralization were identified on the original property from historic surface work and drilling, and are referred to as the Main zone, North Hill and 4-T. Each trend remains open to the southeast and north, and new parallel zones have been discovered. Structural features and zones of mineralization within the structures follow an overall northwest-southeast trend of mineralization. Mineralization extends along a 1.2-kilometre trend. Only half of that trend has been drill tested so far.Pilar drill highlights:2022 phase 3 diamond drilling highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):116.9 metres of 1.2 grams per tonne gold, including 10.2 m of 12 g/t Au and 23 g/t silver;108.9 m of 0.8 g/t Au, including 9.4 m of 7.6 g/t Au and 5 g/t Ag;63.4 m of 0.6 g/t Au and 11 g/t Ag, including 29.9 m of 0.9 g/t Au and 18 g/t Ag;2021 phase 2 RC drilling highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):39.7 m of 1.0 g/t Au, including 1.5 m of 14.6 g/t Au;47.7 m of 0.7 g/t Au, including three m of 5.6 g/t Au and 22 g/t Ag;29 m of 0.7 g/t Au;35.1 m of 0.7 g/t Au;2020 phase 1 RC drilling highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):94.6 m of 1.6 g/t Au, including 9.2 m of 10.8 g/t Au and 38 g/t Ag;41.2 m of 1.1 g/t Au, including 3.1 m of 6.0 g/t Au and 12 g/t Ag;24.4 m of 2.5 g/t Au and 73 g/t Ag, including 1.5 m of 33.4 g/t Au and 1,090 g/t Ag;15,000 m of historic core and RC drilling; highlights include:61.0 m of 0.8 g/t Au;21.0 m of 38.3 g/t Au and 38 g/t Ag;13.0 m of 9.6 g/t Au;9.0 m of 10.2 g/t Au and 46 g/t Ag.Pilar bulk sample summary:62-per-cent recovery of gold achieved over 46-day leaching period;Head grade calculated at 1.9 g/t Au and seven g/t Ag; extracted grade calculated at 1.2 g/t Au and three g/t Ag;Bulk sample only included coarse fraction of material;Fine fraction indicates rapid recovery with agitated leach:Agitated bottle roll test returned rapid and high recovery results: 80-per-cent recovery of gold and 94-per-cent recovery of silver after rapid 24-hour retention time.Additional metallurgical studies:Gravity recovery with agitated leach results of five composite samples returned:95- to 99-per-cent recovery of gold;73- to 97-per-cent recovery of silver;Includes the recovery of 99 per cent Au and 73 per cent Ag from drill core composite at 120-metre depth.Technical information expressed in this news release is the view of Brodie A.

The 2024 drilling program intersected significant silver and gold mineralization in multiple veins across the San Dimas property. The drilling results successfully expanded Mineral Resources and will convert Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources, and ultimately to Mineral Reserves.\"At the beginning of the year we planned a robust exploration program at our San Dimas mine which has returned impressive results,\" stated Keith Neumeyer, President & CEO of First Majestic. \"Our exploration teams have completed approximately 113,000 metres of drilling within the district and have intersected significant silver and gold mineralization in multiple veins. Through the process of successfully converting Inferred to Indicated Resources at the Perez and Sinaloa-Elia veins, the program derisked mineralization for mining in 2025 and 2026.\"SAN DIMAS DRILLING HIGHLIGHTS:Select highlights from the Company's 2024 exploration program includes the following high-grade silver and gold intercepts:Perez Vein Highlights (true width):PE24_397:10.03 g/t Au and 1,996 g/t Ag over 3.65 metres (\"m\");PE24_343:6.28 g/t Au and 1,001 g/t Ag over 2.30 m;PE23_328:3.66 g/t Au and 485 g/t Ag over 3.14 m;PE24_346:2.00 g/t Au and 309 g/t Ag over 5.06 m.Sinaloa-Elia Vein System Highlights (true width):SIN24_120:23.33 g/t Au and 1,045 g/t Ag over 1.31 m;SIN24_106:6.61 g/t Au and 501 g/t Ag over 2.97 m;SIN24_109:10.91 g/t Au and 796 g/t Ag over 1.69 m;SIN24_103:8.31 g/t Au and 507 g/t Ag over 1.64 m.Santa Teresa Vein Highlights (true width):ST24_067:10.02 g/t Au and 359 g/t Ag over 3.41 m;ST24_051:3.11 g/t Au and 166 g/t Ag over 5.86 m;ST24_065:13.53 g/t Au and 211 g/t Ag over 1.69 m.Jessica East Vein Highlights (true width):SJE24_480:2.22 g/t Au and 422 g/t Ag over 0.75 m;SJE24_479:2.27 g/t Au and 223 g/t Ag over 0.78 m.SAN DIMAS EXPLORATION RESULTSExploration drilling at San Dimas intersected significant silver and gold mineralization in multiple veins. Results from four of the veins are highlighted here: Perez, Sinaloa-Elia, Santa Teresa and Jessica East (Figure 1).Figure 1:San Dimas District Vein Occurrence Map and Highlighted Target AreasExploration drilling of the Perez vein extended silver and gold mineralization up-dip in the west-central portion of the vein and converted Inferred to Indicated resources refining vein width and grades. This process derisked mineralization that will be mined during 2025 and 2026. The Perez vein potential remains open to the east and to the west (Figure 2). Select drill hole assay grades and true width intervals of the Perez vein intersections are highlighted below:PE24_397:10.03 g/t Au and 1,996 g/t Ag over 3.65 m;PE24_343:6.28 g/t Au and 1,001 g/t Ag over 2.30 m;PE23_328:3.66 g/t Au and 485 g/t Ag over 3.14 m;PE24_346:2.00 g/t Au and 309 g/t Ag over 5.06 m.At the historic Sinaloa-Elia vein system located in the western portion of the property, drilling intersected several intervals of silver and gold mineralization. Resource conversion drilling confirmed and further delineated mineralization below the Sinaloa vein with several intersections returning better than expected values. Results also reveal that the mineralization is open to the west for potential Mineral Resource expansion. Follow-up expansionary drilling below historic mine excavations at Elia confirmed the presence of down-dip extension potential with some results initially reported in June 2024 (Figure 3). Select drill hole assay grades and true width intervals of the Sinaloa-Elia vein system intersections are highlighted below:SIN24_120:23.33 g/t Au and 1,045 g/t Ag over 1.31 m;SIN24_106:6.61 g/t Au and 501 g/t Ag over 2.97 m;SIN24_109:10.91 g/t Au and 796 g/t Ag over 1.69 m;SIN24_103:8.31 g/t Au and 507 g/t Ag over 1.64 m;EL24_280:2.52 g/t Au and 182 g/t Ag over 1.26m.Expansionary drilling of the Santa Teresa vein has returned significant intercepts both in eastern and western unexplored projection of the vein. Drilling followed up on results reported in June 2024 and confirmed vein continuity and silver and gold mineralization; there is, to the west, approximately 1 kilometres of strike length of open potential (Figure 4). Select drill hole assay grades and true width intervals of the Santa Teresa vein intersections are highlighted below:ST24_067:10.02 g/t Au and 359 g/t Ag over 3.41 m;ST24_051:3.11 g/t Au and 166 g/t Ag over 5.86 m;ST24_065:13.53 g/t Au and 211 g/t Ag over 1.69 m.A review of exploration upside on major past producing veins has identified multiple targets and opportunities for further mineral resource expansion along strike and up and down-dip. Initial drilling on the eastern projection of the Jessica vein (one of the historic top 5 past producing veins in the district) has intersected veins and returned two encouraging results separated by ~250 m; drilling continues to test the area (Figure 5).SJE24_480:2.22 g/t Au and 422 g/t Ag over 0.75 m;SJE24_479:2.27 g/t Au and 223 g/t Ag over 0.78 m.Figure 2:Perez Vein Vertical Long Section

holes are Diamond Drill; AgEq grade = silver grade (g/t) + [gold grade (g/t)*80].From and Length indicated in metres, true width of the intercept is calculated per drill hole and vein angles.See Appendix for details regarding drill hole locations, sample type, azimuth, dip and total depth.Where present, single samples or intercepts with assay results higher than 700 g/t AgEq are highlighted as \"Include\" in each intercept.At San Dimas, silver and gold drill hole intercepts were composited using the length weighted averages of uncapped sample assays, a 215 g/t AgEq minimum grade, and a minimum composite length of 0.7 m (true width). A maximum one metre below the minimum grade was allowed as internal dilution and a single sample below the minimum but above 100 g/t AgEq was allowed in the hanging or footwall to achieve minimum true width in select cases. True width of intercepts is calculated based on current understanding of drill hole and vein angle geometry. All individual samples or intercepts higher than 700 g/t AgEq are reported as \"include\".First Majestic's drilling programs follow established QA/QC insertion protocols with standards, blanks and duplicates introduced to the sample stream and submission of check duplicates to an independent third-party laboratory. After geological logging, all drill core samples are cut in half. One half of the core is submitted to the laboratory for analysis and the remaining half is retained on-site for verification and reference purposes.Core samples were submitted to First Majestic's owned and operated Central Laboratory (ISO 9001:2015).At the Central Lab, gold is analyzed by fire assay with atomic absorption finish (Au-AA13), and by fire assay gravimetric finish (ASAG-13-Au, ASAG-15-Au). Results above 10 g/t gold are analyzed by 30 g fire assay gravimetric finish (ASAG-14). Silver is analyzed by 3-Acid digest atomic absorption finish (AAG-13) or by 30 g fire assay gravimetric finish (ASAG-13-Ag). Results above 200 g/t silver are analyzed by 30 g fire assay gravimetric finish (ASAG-14).For further information concerning QA/QC and data verification matters, key assumptions, parameters, and methods used by the Company to estimate Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, and for a detailed description of known legal, political, environmental, and other risks that could materially affect the Company's business and the potential development of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, see the Company's most recent Annual Information Form available atwww.sedarplus.ca.QUALIFIED PERSONGonzalo Mercado, P.

To date there are several target areas in the district with one already hosting a high-grade gold-silverJORC resource at El Refugio (529koz AuEq @6.81 g/t AuEq)1supported by aconceptional underground mining studycompleted on the maiden resource in early 2022 (seeASX announcement 01 March 2022andmetallurgical test work(seeASX Announcement 25 February 2022). There is considerable strike and depth potential to increase the resource at El Refugio and at other target areas across the district, plus the underlying geologic system that is responsible for the widespread gold-silver mineralisation.With the district-wide gold and silver occurrences and rapid exploration success, it is clear the Copalquin District isdeveloping into another significant gold-silver district like the many other districts in this prolific Sierra Madre Gold-Silver Trend of Mexico.Drilling is in progress at the Target 1 drill area where the current maiden resource drilling is scheduled to be completed by end of Q1 2025. Channel sampling work, using a diamond rock saw, has continuedadjacent to the Target 1 area and immediately to the south towards the Copalquin creek, as highlighted below inFigure 1. Drilling is planned to commence with the second drill rig at the Target 2 area by April 2025.Figure1LiDAR hill shade image with the historic workings identified across the district and 2020-2022 highlight channel sample results.  Target 1 area current drilling location, channel sampling area and the high priority drill target areas of Las Brujas-El Peru and La Constancia-El Jabali.  Several new areas highlighted across the district for follow-up work.Drill Results DiscussionRecent drilling successfully intercepted shallow mineralisation in the El Cometa area on the eastern side of the Target 1 resource area with multiple intercepts, adding, to the data for the upcoming resource update.  The near surface (<100m down hole) cut-off for reporting the intercepts in the El Cometa area is lower (0.25 g/t AuEq2compared with 1.00 g/t AuEq2for >100m down hole intercept reporting) reflecting its potential for lower cost mining methods.Two further drill holes have been completed in this area this month and the drill is currently on its third hole at La Soledad, all within the Target 1 resource update area.  Drilling within the Target 1 area is continuing throughout the quarter, ahead of the Target 1 resource update.El Cometa features a broad mineralised structure with cross cutting structures hosting very high-grade gold and silver, such as reported from drill holeCDH-159in 2024 (33.00m @31.8 g/t gold, 274 g/t silver from surface)Each of the drill holes returned reportable shallow intercepts.

The district is within the Sierra Madre Gold Silver Trend which extends north-south along the western side of Mexico and hosts many world-class gold and silver deposits.Multiple mineralisation events, young intrusives thought to be system-driving heat sources, widespread alteration together with extensive surface vein exposures and dozens of historic mine workings, identify the Copalquin mining district as a major epithermal centre for Gold and Silver.Within 15 months of drilling in the Copalquin District, Mithril delivered a maiden JORC mineral resource estimate demonstrating the high-grade gold and silver resource potential for the district. This maiden resource is detailed below (seeASX release 17 November 2021)^and NI43-101 Technical Report filed on SEDAR+2,416,000 tonnes4.80 g/t gold, 141 g/t silverfor373,000 oz goldplus10,953,000 oz silver (Total 529,000 oz AuEq*) using a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t AuEq*28.6% of the resource tonnage is classified as indicatedTonnes(kt)Tonnes(kt)Gold(g/t)Silver(g/t)Gold Eq.*(g/t)Gold(koz)Silver(koz)Gold Eq.*(koz)El RefugioIndicated6915.43114.27.061212,538157Inferred1,4474.63137.16.592156,377307La SoledadIndicated-------Inferred2784.12228.27.38372,03766TotalIndicated6915.43114.27.061212,538157Inferred1,7254.55151.76.722528,414372TOTAL2,4164.801416.8137310,953529Table1-Mineral resource estimate El Refugio – La Soledad using a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t AuEq**  The gold equivalent (AuEq.) values are determined from gold and silver values and assume the following:  AuEq. = gold equivalent calculated using and gold:silver price ratio of 70:1.  That is, 70 g/t silver = 1 g/t gold.  The metal prices used to determine the 70:1 ratio are the cumulative average prices for 2021: gold USD1,798.34 and silver: USD25.32 (actual is 71:1) from kitco.com.  Metallurgical recoveries are assumed to be approximately equal for both gold and silver at this early stage. Actual metallurgical recoveries from test work to date are 96% and 91% for gold and silver, respectively.  In the Company’s opinion there is reasonable potential for both gold and silver to be extracted and sold. Actual metal prices have not been used in resource estimate, only the price ratio for the AuEq reporting. Formula for AuEq. = Au grade +((Ag grade/gold:silver price ratio) x (Ag recovery/Au recovery))^The information in this report that relates to Mineral Resources or Ore Reserves is based on information provided in the following ASX announcement: 17 Nov 2021 - MAIDEN JORC RESOURCE 529,000 OUNCES @ 6.81G/T (AuEq*), which includes the full JORC MRE report, also available on the Mithril Resources Limited Website.The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the original market announcement and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed.

Code, 2012 Edition – Table 1Section 1 Sampling Techniques and DataCriteriaJORC Code explanationCommentarySampling techniquesNature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.Samples for the Copalquin, Mexico drill programs consist of ½ HQ core cut lengthwise with a diamond saw. Intervals are nominally 1 m but may vary between 1.5 m to 0.5 m based on geologic criteria.Deeper portions of holes from CDH-075 onward consist of ½ NQ core. Sample sizes are tracked by core diameter and sample weights.The same side of the core is always sent to sample (left side of saw).Reported intercepts are calculated as either potentially underground mineable (below 120m below surface) or as potentially open-pit mineable (near surface).Potentially underground mineable intercepts are calculated as length weighted averages of material greater than 1 g/t AuEQ_70 allowing up to 2m of internal dilution.Potentially open-pit mineable intercepts are calculated as length weighted averages of material greater than 0.25 g/t AuEQ_70 allowing for up to 2m of internal dilution.Rock chip sampling is done with hammer and chisel along continuous chip lines oriented perpendicular to the mineralized structure. The samples are as representative as possible.Drilling techniquesDrill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).Drilling is done with an MP500 man-portable core rig capable of drilling HQ size core to depths of 400 m. Core is recovered in a standard tube. Less than 7% of the total core drilled is NQ size core (as of 2022-01-15).Drill sample recoveryMethod of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples.Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.Drill recovery is measured based on measured length of core divided by length of drill run.Recovery in holes CDH-001 through CDH-025 and holes CDH-032 through CDH-077 was always above 90% in the mineralized zones. Detailed core recovery data are maintained in the project database.Holes CDH-026 through CDH-031 had problems with core recovery in highly fractured, clay rich breccia zones.There is no adverse relationship between recovery and grade identified to date.LoggingWhether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography.The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.•        Core samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.•        Core logging is both qualitative or quantitative in nature. Photos are taken of each box of core before samples are cut. Core is wetted to improve visibility of features in the photos.All core has been logged and photographed.Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparationIf core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry.For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples.Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling.Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.•        Core is sawn and half core is taken for sample.•        Samples are prepared using ALS Minerals Prep-31 crushing, splitting and pulverizing. This is appropriate for the type of deposit being explored.•        Visual review to assure that the cut core is ½ of the core is performed to assure representativity of samples.•        field duplicate/second-half sampling is undertaken for 3% of all samples to determine representativity of the sample media submitted.Sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.Quality of assay data and laboratory testsThe nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.•        Samples are assayed for gold using ALS Minerals Au-AA25 method a 30 g fire assay with an AA finish. This is considered a total assay technique.Samples are assayed for silver using ALS Minerals ME-ICP61 method. Over limits are assayed by AgOG63 and AgGRAV21. These are considered a total assay technique.Standards, blanks and duplicates are inserted appropriately into the sample stream.  External laboratory checks will be conducted as sufficient samples are collected. Levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have not yet been established.Soil samplingis also subject to a program of standards and blanks using the X-ray florescence (XRF) analyser. Results are acceptable. Samples were analysed using three wavelengths 50Kv, 40 Kv and 15 Kv for times of 120 seconds, 30 seconds and 30 seconds respectively.Samples with significant amounts of observed visible gold are also assayed by AuSCR21, a screen assay that analyses gold in both the milled pulp and in the residual oversize from pulverization. This has been done for holes CDH-075 and CDH-077.Verification of sampling and assayingThe verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel.The use of twinned holes.Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.Discuss any adjustment to assay data.•        The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel has not been conducted. A re-assay program of pulp duplicates is currently in progress.•        The use of twinned holes. No twin holes have been drilled.MTH has drilled one twin hole. Hole CDH-072, reported in the 15/6/2021 announcement, is a twin of holes EC-/002 and UC-03. Results are comparable.•        Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols are maintained in the company’s core facility.Assay data have not been adjusted other than applying length weighted averages to reported intercepts.Location of data pointsAccuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.Specification of the grid system used.Quality and adequacy of topographic control.•        Drill collar coordinates are currently located by handheld GPS. Precise survey of hole locations is planned. Downhole surveys of hole deviation are recorded for all holes. Locations for holes CDH-001 through CDH-048 and CDH-051 through CDH-148 have been surveyed with differential GPS to a sub 10 cm precision.Hole CDH-005 was not surveyed•        UTM/UPS WGS 84 zone 13 NHigh quality topographic control from Photosat covers the entire drill project area.Data spacing and distributionData spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.Whether sample compositing has been applied.•        Data spacing is appropriate for the reporting of Exploration Results.•        The Resource estimation re-printed in this announcement was originally released on 16 Nov 2021No sample compositing has been applied.Orientation of data in relation to geological structureWhether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.•        Cut lines are marked on the core by the geologists to assure that the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures. This is reasonably well observed in the core and is appropriate to the deposit type.The relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is not considered to have introduced a sampling bias.Sample securityThe measures taken to ensure sample security.Samples are stored in a secure core storage facility until they are shipped off site by small aircraft and delivered directly to ALS Global.Audits or reviewsThe results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.A review with spot checks was conducted by AMC in conjunction with the resource estimate published 16 Nov 2021.

This deposit type is common in the Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico and is characterized by quartz veins and stockworks surrounded by haloes of argillic (illite/smectite) alteration. Veins have formed as both low-angle semi-continuous lenses parallel to the contact between granodiorite and andesite and as tabular veins in high-angle normal faults. Vein and breccia thickness has been observed up to 30 meters wide with average widths on the order of 3 to 5 meters. The overall strike length of the semi-continuous mineralized zone from El Gallo to Refugio, Cometa, Los Pinos, Los Reyes, La Montura to Constancia is almost 6 kilometres. The southern area from Apomal to San Manuel and to Las Brujas-El Peru provides additional exploration potential up to 5km.Drill hole InformationA summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:easting and northing of the drill hole collar• elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation abovesea level in metres) of the drill hole collardip and azimuth of the holedown hole length and interception depthhole length.If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.DrillholeEastingNorthingElevationAzimuthDipFinal DepthCDH-1672896072823791117624075357MTH-EC24-012896122823837115525050291MTH-EC24-022896622823808115225050258MTH-EC24-032895822823849114525050330MTH-EC24-042896192823766116833050240MTH-EC24-052896032823896114825050381MTH-EC25-062896122823805117414550207MTH-EC25-072895062823824118624870210MTH-LS25-082896152824074115521060201MTH-LS25-092895702824106118121060210MTH-LS25-102896432824122114821060In progressData aggregation methodsIn reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.Intercepts are reported for all intercepts greater than or equal to 1 g/t AuEQ_70 using a 70:1 Silver to gold price ratio. No upper cut-off is applied to reporting intercepts.Length weighted averaging is used to report intercepts. The example of CDH-002 is shown.

Holes drilled at -50 degrees may be considered to have intercept lengths equal to true-widths, Holes drilled at -70 degrees have true widths approximately 92% of the reported intercept lengths and holes drilled at -90 degrees have true widths of 77% of the reported intercept lengths.True widths are not known at La Soledad and downhole intercepts are reported.DiagramsAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported. These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.See figures in announcementBalanced reportingWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.All exploration results are reported.Other substantive exploration dataOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.No additional exploration data are substantive at this time.Metallurgical test work on drill core composite made of crushed drill core from the El Refugio drill hole samples has been conducted.The samples used for the test work are representative of the material that makes up the majority of the Maiden Resource Estimate for El Refugio release on 17thNovember 2021.The test work was conducted by SGS laboratory Mexico using standard reagents and test equipment.Further workThe nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.Exploration results from the Copalquin District reporting in this release.1See ‘About Copalquin Gold Silver Project’ section for JORC MRE details and AuEq. calculation.2See ‘About Copalquin Gold Silver Project’ section for JORC MRE details and AuEq. calculation."

        "content": "Highlights:Surface Sample Results Yield More Targets in Southern Expansion BlockFour New Target Areas IdentifiedRock Chips Up to 3.1 g/t Au, 64 g/t Ag, 0.67% Cu and 0.92% PbCore Drilling Ongoing at Pilar's Main Zone, Four (4) Holes Completed to DateHERMOSILLO, MEXICO / ACCESS Newswire / January 22, 2025 /Tocvan Ventures Corp.(the \"Company\") (CSE:TOC) (OTCQB:TCVNF) (WKN:TV3/A2PE64), is pleased to announce new surface exploration results from its Gran Pilar Gold Silver Project in mine-friendly Sonora, Mexico. A total of 188 rock samples and 9 infill soil samples were analyzed from the Southern Block of the 100% controlled Expansion Area. Four new target areas have been identified spanning an area 1.8-kilometers long and 1.0-kilometer wide. A summary of the top surface results is provided in Table 1 and Figure 1. An additional area 2.1-kilometers by 1.4-kilometers remains unsampled to the east. Five kilometers to the north in an area referred to as the North Alteration Zone, early geochemical sampling, alteration mapping and satellite data interpretation suggests a separate large scale (3.2-kilometers long by 1.5-kilometers wide) epithermal target exists. The Company plans to continue the steady advancement of these areas as they present significant exploration targets.Core drilling continues at Pilar's Main Zone where four drillholes have been completed so far totaling over 408-meters. As drilling continues logging and sample preparation is underway to evaluate the core results for incorporation into a resource model. The aim of the core program is to build out a more robust geological model across the area. Each hole completed has successfully intersected lithologies and structures (vein zones, breccia zones and/or large fault gouges) known to host and control gold - silver mineralization at Pilar that will aid in modelling. The Company cautions these are visual indications, assay results are pending to verify the grade of mineralization. RC drilling will recommence shortly on the expansion area to continue to test the northern extension of mineralization.\"The latest surface exploration results are adding to our list of targets across the Southern Block.\" commented, CEO Brodie Sutherland. \"Given how early we are in development of this area, it has yielded encouraging results across a large footprint that extends two kilometers east and 900-meters north of our Main Zone. What excites us about these targets is the fact that back at our Main Zone historic sampling yielded similar results where there is significant exposure across roadcuts and trenches. Here in the Expansion Area, we are only seeing naturally exposed windows into the subsurface, we will look to advance these through trenching and drilling this year. Much of the southern area now has road access, speeding up the advancement of the area. The Southern Block has kept us occupied, we have not yet begun to detail sample and evaluate the potential of the Northern Block. Early recon sampling has shown significant potential for a large-scale epithermal system, we think is separate to what is observed to the south proximal to our Main Zone. Field observations lead us to believe the two areas represent potential for two separate mineralized systems across the project area greatly expanding our resource potential.\"Figure 1.Surface Rock Sampling Results from Gran Pilar Southern Block.Figure 2.Soil Sampling Results from Gran Pilar Southern Block.Table 1.Summary of Top Rock Sample Results from Latest Exploration Work across Gran Pilar.Table 2.Summary of new infill soil sample results from Gran Pilar.Figure 3.Gran Pilar Project Overview, > 22km2of prospective ground.Pilar Drill Highlights:2024 RC Drilling Highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):42.7m @ 1.0 g/t Au, including 3.1m @ 10.9 g/t Au56.4m @ 1.0 g/t Au, including 3.1m @ 14.7 g/t Au16.8m @ 0.8 g/t Au and 19 g/t Ag2022 Phase III Diamond Drilling Highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):116.9m @ 1.2 g/t Au, including 10.2m @ 12 g/t Au and 23 g/t Ag108.9m @ 0.8 g/t Au, including 9.4m @ 7.6 g/t Au and 5 g/t Ag63.4m @ 0.6 g/t Au and 11 g/t Ag, including 29.9m @ 0.9 g/t Au and 18 g/t Ag2021 Phase II RC Drilling Highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):39.7m @ 1.0 g/t Au, including 1.5m @ 14.6 g/t Au47.7m @ 0.7 g/t Au including 3m @ 5.6 g/t Au and 22 g/t Ag29m @ 0.7 g/t Au35.1m @ 0.7 g/t Au2020 Phase I RC Drilling Highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):94.6m @ 1.6 g/t Au, including 9.2m @ 10.8 g/t Au and 38 g/t Ag;41.2m @ 1.1 g/t Au, including 3.1m @ 6.0 g/t Au and 12 g/t Ag ;24.4m @ 2.5 g/t Au and 73 g/t Ag, including 1.5m @ 33.4 g/t Au and 1,090 g/t Ag15,000m of Historic Core & RC drilling.

The facility would underpin a robust test mine scenario with aims to process up to 50,000 tonnes of material. Timelines and budget are being prepared with the aim of moving forward with the development early in 2025. With gold prices hitting all-time highs, the Company believes the onsite test mine will provide key economic parameters and showcase the mineral potential of the area. In 2023, the Company completed an offsite bulk sample that produced important data showcasing the potential to recover both gold and silver through a variety of methods including heap leach, gravity and agitated leach (see August 22, 2023, news release for more details).About Tocvan Ventures Corp.Tocvan's advancing gold-silver projects are located in the mine-friendly jurisdiction of Sonora, Mexico. Through ongoing exploration programs, Company is unveiling the high-potential at its Gran Pilar Gold-Silver Project where it holds 100% interests in over 21 square kilometers of prospective area and a majority ownership (51%) in a one square kilometer area shared with Colibri Resources. The Company also holds 100% interest in the Picacho Gold-Silver project in the Caborca Trend of northern Sonora, a trend host to some of the major gold deposits of the region. Management feels both projects represent tremendous opportunity to create shareholder value. Tocvan has approximately 56 million shares outstanding.Quality Assurance / Quality ControlRock samples were shipped for sample preparation to ALS Limited in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico and for analysis at the ALS laboratory in North Vancouver.

        "content": "DALLAS, TX / ACCESS Newswire / January 22, 2025 /United States Antimony Corporation(\"USAC,\" or the \"Company\"), (NYSE:UAMY) is providing an operational update today on its Madero, Mexico Smelter.Last week, a management team comprised of five members of the company, traveled to our 100% owned Madero Smelter, located in the state of Coahuila in Mexico. The purpose of the trip was to perform a complete operational review and assessment of improvements required to get this facility up and running again as quickly as possible. Initial plans are for the Madero Smelter to process antimony ore in an amount approximating 100 tons per month. The first international supply of raw antimony ore contracted by the Company is on the water and scheduled to arrive in Mexico sometime in early March 2025.There currently exists a total of 17 furnaces at this facility, three large and 14 small furnaces. After meeting with several different qualified Mexican contractors this past week, repairs and refurbishment of at least six of these furnaces will be made over the next 30 days. Additional replacement and repairs include air compressors, construction of air control plenum systems (tin huts over furnaces), tilting of certain furnaces, etc.While the Madero Smelter is currently operational, part of this capital expenditure program, estimated to be less than $1 Million, is also geared to more streamline antimony feedstock in a faster, more mechanical, and less human interaction manner. This will allow the Company to gradually increase throughput in the future.Commenting on this update, Mr. John C. Gustavsen, President of the Antimony Division of the Company, stated, \"We have a great seasoned working team assembled who are excited to complete the refurbishing of the Madero Smelter. We have already rehired field personnel who are crucial in achieving our work program objectives. We anticipate being fully prepared when our first international shipments begin arriving in early March. Worldwide antimony prices continue to reach all-time highs with current prices exceeding $20.00 per pound. We are working as quickly as possible in achieving our corporate goals of beginning to meet our nation's overall antimony demands.\"About USACUnited States Antimony Corporation and its subsidiaries in the U.S. and Mexico (\"USAC,\" the \"Company,\" \"Our,\" \"Us,\" or \"We\") sell processed antimony, zeolite, and precious metals products in the U.S. and Canada. The Company processes antimony ore primarily into antimony oxide, antimony metal, and antimony trisulfide. Our antimony oxide is used to form a flame-retardant system for plastics, rubber, fiberglass, textile goods, paints, coatings, and paper, as a color fastener in paint, and as a phosphorescent agent in fluorescent light bulbs. Our antimony metal is used in bearings, storage batteries, and ordnance. Our antimony trisulfide is used as a primer in ammunition. In its operations in Idaho, the Company mines and processes zeolite, a group of industrial minerals used in soil amendment and fertilizer, water filtration, sewage treatment, nuclear waste and other environmental cleanup, odor control, gas separation, animal nutrition, and other miscellaneous applications. We recover certain amounts of precious metals, primarily gold and silver, at our plant in Montana from antimony concentrates.Forward-Looking StatementsReaders should note that, in addition to the historical information contained herein, this press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of, and intended to be covered by, the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Movement of waste totaled 3,670,138 tonnes, for a strip ratio of 5.1:1. The Antenna pit was the primary source of production, yielding 530,651 tonnes of ore, with the Koula and Ancien pits contributing the remainder.Séguéla produced 35,244 ounces of gold at an average head grade of 2.95 g/t Au, a 0.7 and9.7 percent increase, respectively, compared to the third quarter in 2024. Despite higher grades in the fourth quarter, production remained essentially unchanged quarter over quarter due to inventory movements in the plant circuit. The higher gold grade is in line with the planned mining sequence and is representative of the life of mine grade. Plant throughput for the quarter averaged 208 tonnes per hour (tph), which is 35 percent higher than name plate design capacity of 154 tph.AISC for the full year is expected to be within the 2024 guidance range of between $1,110 and$1,230 per ounce sold, with AISC in the fourth quarter above the average for the year, reflecting higher capex execution in the last quarter of 2024.Yaramoko Mine, Burkina FasoAchieves top end of guidance for gold productionQ4 2024FY 20242024 GuidanceTonnes milled102,105454,969-Average tpd milled1,1221,243-Gold grade (g/t)9.188.21-Gold recovery (%)98.1698.12-Gold production1(oz)29,576116,206105,000 - 119,000Note:Production includes doré onlyHighlightsOne-million-ounce gold pour milestone in May 20241Fourth consecutive year free of lost time injuriesIn the fourth quarter, 102,105 tonnes of ore were treated at an average head grade of9.18 g/t Au, producing 29,576 ounces of gold. This represents a 37 percent increase in grade, and a 6 percent increase in ounces, compared to the third quarter in 2024. The reduced tonnage milled was primarily due to the failure of the mill variable speed drive circuit breaker which resulted in approximately 16 days of lost milling time. The increased head grade is attributable to ore being mainly sourced from stoping operations in the 55 Zone and QVP as development operations decrease. In 55 Zone, ore development was completed during the quarter, and waste development operations are scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. At the 109 Zone, open pit mobilization operations commenced, with mining due to start later in the first quarter of 2025.During the quarter, 117,817 tonnes of ore were mined averaging 8.5 g/t Au from the 55 Zone and QVP.AISC for the full year is expected to be slightly above the 2024 guidance range of between $1,220 and $1,320 per ounce sold. This was driven by successful exploration results and the required additional mine development, consistent with the extension of the life of mine into 2025.Note:Refer to Fortuna news release dated May 22, 2024: “Fortuna’s Yaramoko Mine reaches one-million-ounce gold pour milestone”Lindero Mine, ArgentinaAchieves guidance for gold productionQ4 2024FY 20242024 GuidanceOre placed on pad (t)1,757,2906,367,505-Gold grade (g/t)0.600.62-Gold production (oz)126,80697,28793,000 - 105,000Note:Gold production includes doré, gold in carbon, and gold in copper concentrateHighlightLeach pad expansion entered operation in the fourth quarter of 2024; delivered into operation on time and on budget.In the fourth quarter, 2.05 million tonnes of ore were mined, with a stripping ratio of 1.54:1.A total of 1.76 million tonnes of ore were placed on the leach pad averaging 0.60 g/t Au, containing an estimated 34,151 ounces of gold.Gold production for the quarter was 26,806 ounces of gold, comprised of 24,679 ounces in doré bars, 2,086 ounces contained in rich fine carbon, and 41 ounces contained in copper precipitate. The10 percent increase in production, when compared to the previous quarter, is due to a higher rate of pregnant solution percolation related to the first lift of ore placed on the new leach pad expansion area. The mine began placing ore on the expanded leach pad in the second half of October 2024. By year end, the $51.8 million leach pad expansion project was approximately 88 percent complete, with$6 million remaining to be spent in the first quarter of 2025. This will be used to finalize minor construction activities, demobilize construction contractors, and close out the project. The leach pad expansion is expected to be completed on budget.Lindero’s energy supplier commenced work on a 14.5 MWh solar power plant project in September of 2024. Currently, the project is 41 percent complete, and a 1 MWh battery energy storage system has already been installed and linked to the existing power plant. The project is expected to be complete by the third quarter of 2025.AISC for the full year is expected to be towards the higher end of the 2024 guidance range between $1,730 and $1,950 per ounce sold, principally due to the appreciation of the Argentine peso throughout the year. However, AISC is expected to improve in 2025 as disclosed in the Lindero outlook section.Operational efficiency initiatives related to mine, plant capacity, and gold recoveryOptimized the drill bit diameter for production drilling, resulting in a 38 percent improvement in productivity per meter drilled.Commenced project to change the loading and haulage fleet from 100-tonne trucks and shovels to 40-tonne trucks and excavators. This project is expected to reduce capital expenditures, diesel consumption, improve supply options for spare parts, and reduce inventory levels over the life of mine.Optimization of the primary and secondary crushers achieved a 13 percent increase in hourly throughput compared to the previous year.HPGR attained a 12 percent reduction in average particle size, aiming to improve gold recovery.The SART plant achieved a 20 percent reduction in consumption of key reagents when compared to design KPIs.Cyanide consumption was reduced by 10 percent compared to the previous year, bringing the current consumption down to 0.28 kg/t.Optimization of the adsorption columns and pressure vessels increased flow by 10 percent, leading to improved gold extraction.Once completed, the solar power plant is expected to generate annual savings of approximately $1.8 million by replacing an estimated 40 percent of diesel consumption with solar power generation, whilst reducing the carbon footprint by approximately 10,630 t/year of CO2emissions.These initiatives are aligned with Fortuna’s continuous improvement strategy, and the operation continues to identify opportunities to improve its competitiveness.San Jose Mine, MexicoProduction from the tail end of reservesQ4 2024FY 20242024 GuidanceTonnes milled190,063735,591-Average tpd milled2,4372,138-Silver grade (g/t)118125-Silver recovery (%)82.7086.07-Silver production (oz)594,3732,548,4023,100,000 - 3,600,000Gold grade (g/t)0.850.89-Gold recovery (%)81.9684,76-Gold production (oz)4,23917,81119,000 - 23,000HighlightSubsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company announced the sale of the non-coreSan Jose Mine1,2In the fourth quarter, the San Jose Mine produced 594,373 ounces of silver and 4,239 ounces of gold at average head grades of 118 g/t Ag and 0.85 g/t Au, an increase of 16 and 12 percent, respectively, when compared to the third quarter of 2024. The positive results were due to higher grades being mined, with the processing plant milling 190,063 tonnes at an average rate of 2,437 tonnes per day. Metallurgical recoveries continued to be impacted by higher iron oxide material from the upper levels.Annual production of silver and gold were 18 and 6 percent below the lower end of annual guidance, respectively. Approximately 5 percent of the lower production for both metals was due to the effect of the iron oxide in the metallurgical recovery. Head grades for the year were aligned with the geological model, albeit slightly lower than expected.As the mine was operating at the tail end of reserves, lower tonnes than expected were mined in areas which included old adits and stopes with high geologic uncertainty. As a result, the largest impact on annual silver production was due to lower tonnage extracted than anticipated.Notes:Refer to Fortuna news release dated January 15, 2025: “Fortuna announces sale of non-core San Jose Mine, Mexico”Au Eq includes gold, silver, lead and zinc and is calculated using the following metal prices: $2,661/oz Au, $31.26/oz Ag, $2,009/t Pb and $3,046/t Zn or Au:Ag = 1:85.1, Au:Pb = 1:1.32, Au:Zn = 1:0.87Caylloma Mine, PeruStrong performance, exceeding top end of annual production guidance for all metalsQ4 2024FY 20242024 GuidanceTonnes milled139,761551,430-Average tpd milled1,5531,549-Silver grade (g/t)6780-Silver recovery (%)83.3283.29-Silver production (oz)1249,2381,176,543900,000 - 1,100,000Lead grade (%)3.363.57-Lead recovery (%)91.7391.07-Lead production (lbs)9,499,71939,555,33929,000,000 - 34,000,000Zinc grade (%)4.944.71-Zinc recovery (%)91.1490.61-Zinc production (lbs)13,873,69051,905,63536,000,000 - 39,000,000Note:Metallurgical recovery for silver is calculated based on silver content in lead concentrateIn the fourth quarter, the Caylloma Mine produced 249,238 ounces of silver at an average head grade of 67 g/t Ag. While silver production was 18 percent lower than the previous quarter, it was in line with the production sequence for the period. Total silver production for the year was 7 percent higher than the upper end of annual guidance.Zinc and lead production was 13.87 Mlbs and 9.50 Mlbs, respectively for the fourth quarter, with average head grades of 4.94 % Zn and 3.36 % Pb, an increase of 6 percent for zinc and a decrease of 7 percent for lead, when compared to the third quarter of 2024. Zinc and lead production was above the higher end of annual guidance by 33 percent and 16 percent respectively. Increased production is the result of positive grade reconciliation to the reserve model in the lower levels of the underground mine.AISC for 2024 is expected to be towards the high end of annual guidance range between $18 and$21 per ounce sold, due to the impact of a higher silver price relative to zinc and lead in the silver equivalency calculation, resulting in lower equivalent ounces.2025 consolidated production and cost guidanceProduction guidance for 2025 is lower than 2024, due to the anticipated completion of the sale of the non-core San Jose Mine in the first quarter of 2025, and the impact resulting from a higher silver price relative to zinc and lead in the calculation of silver equivalent production at the Caylloma Mine.Cash cost and AISC are guided to be in line with 2024, despite increases in the stripping ratio for both the Lindero and Séguéla mines, which for Lindero is anticipated to peak in 2025 and for Séguéla in 2026. This is expected to be offset by lower capex at both the Lindero and Yaramoko mines. Lindero’s capital investments in equipment and infrastructure are expected to decrease by approximately67 percent, while capital expenditures at Yaramoko are expected to decrease by approximately60 percent.The Company is also capitalizing on various productivity and cost efficiency initiatives in 2025. Several of the main projects already reflected in our AISC projections amount to $16 million in incremental cash flow (pre-tax) at Lindero, and the optimization of the Séguéla processing facility to treat 1.7 million tonnes per year.In addition, the Company is providing 2-year guidance for the Séguéla Mine to reflect the significant improvement in gold production and AISC expected for 2026 at our flagship asset.2025 consolidated production and cost guidance tableMineSilver (Moz)Gold (koz)Lead (Mlbs)Zinc (Mlbs)Cash Cost1,2,3,5AISC1,2,3,5Silver($/oz Ag Eq)($/oz Ag Eq)Caylloma, Peru0.9 - 1.0-29 - 3245 - 4915.0 - 16.621.7 - 24.7Gold($/oz Au)($/oz Au)Lindero, Argentina4-93 - 105--1,060 - 1,2351,600 - 1,770Yaramoko, Burkina Faso-107 - 121--880 - 1,0001,165 - 1,320Séguéla, Côte d´Ivoire-134 - 147--680 - 7501,500 - 1,600Consolidated Total0.9 - 1.0334 - 37329 - 3245 - 49$895 - 1,0156$1,550 - 1,6806Notes:1.  Cash Cost and all-in sustaining cost (AISC) are non-IFRS financial measures which are not standardized financial measures under the financial reporting framework used to prepare the financial statements of the Company and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

Refer to the note under “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” below.2025 OutlookSéguéla’s mine plan considers mining the Antenna, Ancien, and Koula pits, with plans to process1.70 million tonnes of ore averaging 2.8 g/t Au, and capital investments estimated at $91 million, including $67 million for sustaining capital expenditures and $13.5 million for Brownfields exploration programs.Major sustaining capital investments include:Capitalized stripping$47 millionTailings storage facility (TSF) lift$6 millionOther equipment and infrastructure$14 millionCash cost and AISC:Cash cost is expected to be between $680 and $750 per ounce of gold. This represents an increase over 2024 mainly due to higher waste movement as the mine’s stripping ratio rises from 5.7:1 to 14.6:1, in accordance with the mine plan and life of mine average of 13.8:1.AISC is expected to be between $1,500 and $1,600 per ounce of gold, reflecting higher cash cost over 2024 as described above, higher capitalized stripping and an increase in government royalties of2 percent enacted in January 2025.2026 OutlookSéguéla’s mine plan considers a production range of between 160,000 and 180,000 ounces, mining in the Antenna, Ancien, Koula, and Sunbird pits, with plans to process 1.70 million tonnes of ore. Processed gold average head grade is expected to increase 18 percent to 3.3 g/t Au in 2026. The stripping ratio is planned to peak at 17:1. Capital investments are estimated at $48 million, including $38 million for sustaining capital expenditures and $10 million for Brownfields exploration programs.Major sustaining capital investments include:Capitalized stripping$31 millionEquipment and infrastructure$7 millionAISC is expected to be between $1,260 and $1,390 per ounce of gold. The improvement in AISC over 2025 is anticipated to be driven by the 18 percent higher grade referenced above and corresponding higher gold production, and lower projected capital expenditures in equipment and infrastructure.Yaramoko Mine, Burkina FasoContinued strong gold productionThe Yaramoko Mine is scheduled to process 481,000 tonnes of ore averaging 7.7 g/t Au. Capital investment decreases substantially compared to previous years due to the completion of development operations at the 55 Zone.Total sustaining capital expenditure is expected to be $2.5 million, predominantly comprising of the final TSF lift and land compensation. Due to the limited life of mine at Yaramoko, all sustaining capital expenditure has been included in opex costs. Yaramoko has been operating with a short life of mineral reserves for the last three years, and through successful exploration and mine development has been able to expand its mine life year-over-year. Currently, the life of mine is scheduled to end in 2026.Cash cost and AISC:Cash cost is expected to be between $880 and $1,000 per ounce of gold.AISC is expected to improve in 2025 to between $1,165 and $1,320 per ounce of gold, as a result of 60 percent lower capex year over year.Lindero Mine, ArgentinaCapitalizing on optimization initiativesThe Lindero Mine is expected to place 7.2 million tonnes of ore on the leach pad averaging 0.58 g/t Au, containing an estimated 133,776 ounces of gold. Capital investments are estimated at $42.9 million, including $17.4 million in capital projects, $3.4 million in Brownfields exploration and $22.1 million in capitalized stripping costs. The stripping ratio is expected to increase from 1.1 in 2024 to 2.2 in 2025; the peak in the life of mine strip ratio.Major sustaining capital investments include:Capitalized stripping$22.1 millionCompletion of leach pad expansion project$6.0 millionHeavy equipment replacement and overhaul$2.5 millionPlant and mine critical spare parts$4.0 millionCash cost and AISC:Cash cost is expected to increase in 2025 to between $1,060 and $1,235 per ounce of gold, reflecting a higher stripping ratio, the appreciation of the Argentine peso, and lower head grade compared to 2024.AISC is expected to improve in 2025 to between $1,600 and $1,770 per ounce of gold, reflecting lower capital investments in equipment and infrastructure of 67 percent compared to 2024, partially offset by the increase in the cash cost described above. The Company plans to close final leach pad project activities and demobilize contractors in the first quarter of 2025 leading to a higher AISC in the first quarter compared to the average for the year. The Company anticipates the AISC to progressively decrease in the subsequent quarters of the year, aligned with guidance.Caylloma Mine, PeruTrack record of solid performanceThe Caylloma Mine is scheduled to process 0.55 million tonnes of ore averaging 64 g/t Ag,2.8 % Pb, and 4.4 % Zn. Capital investments are estimated at $20.3 million, including $14.6 million for sustaining capital and $4.8 million for Brownfields exploration programs.Sustaining capital investments include:Mine development and infill$5.2 millionEquipment acquisition and energy$3.7 millionOperating permits and tailings management$1.3 millionCash cost and AISC:Cash cost is expected to be between $15.0 and $16.6 per ounce of silver equivalent. AISC is expected to be between $21.7 and $24.7 per ounce of silver equivalent. This represents an increase over 2024 explained by the impact of relative metal prices on silver equivalent production. Higher metal prices for silver relative to zinc and lead, result in lower silver equivalent production. The effect of relative prices used for 2025 guidance, compared to metal prices used in 2024 guidance, represents an estimated impact on AISC of approximately $4 per ounce.2025 Exploration OutlookThe Company has a total mineral exploration budget of $41.0 million for 2025, compared to an estimated $44.0 million invested in 2024. Brownfields represents 53 percent, and greenfield initiatives, including $8.3 million for Diamba Sud, represents 47 percent of this year’s budget.Brownfields ExplorationFortuna’s consolidated Brownfields exploration budget for 2025 totals $21.6 million, which includes 84,000 meters of reverse circulation, diamond core, and air core exploration drilling.

        "content": "Copper grades from the drill results are higher than the ones reported in the current Measured & Indicated Mineral Resource for the Bolivar Mine.These results underscore the Bolivar Mine’s potential for further resource growth and enhanced value creation for stakeholders.TORONTO / Jan 21, 2025 / Business Wire /Sierra Metals Inc. (TSX: SMT | OTCQX: SMTSF | BVL: SMT) (“Sierra Metals” or the “Company”) is pleased to report drill results for the 2024 drill program in the Marian Zone (“Marian”) at the Company’s Bolivar Mine (“Bolivar”) in Mexico (Figure 1).These recent drill results have the potential to increase the Mine’s current mineral resource as set out in the Company’s National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) compliant report entitled “Technical Report on the Bolivar Mine” dated June 14, 2024 (the “Bolivar Technical Report”). By including these new drill holes, the dimensions of the mineralized body have the potential to extend by up to an additional ~300 meters (“m”) along strike and by ~600 m vertically. Additional drilling is planned in 2025 to continue to extend the Marian Zone to the northeast and at depth.Ernesto Balarezo, Sierra Metals CEO, comments, “We are very pleased with the results of our exploration strategy at Bolivar to date and these results only offer what we believe is a glimpse of the mine’s full potential. This drill program in the Marian Zone indicates higher metals grades that have the potential to add to the overall mineral resources at Bolivar. These significant drill results from the Marian Zone reflect the continuous success of our targeted exploration strategy and highlight the untapped potential of the Bolivar Mine. Exploration and drilling, both to replace and continuously grow the mineral resources, are an important part of Sierra’s strategy.”Notable diamond drill intercepts in the Marian Zone:HoleDownholeWidthTrueWidthCu%Aug/tAgg/tZn%DB24BM94128.5026.01.290.3410.870.02DB24BM95123.9520.01.370.3123.520.19DB24BM94313.209.50.850.1423.512.98DB24BM94614.3010.01.260.2640.238.3DB24BM95510.757.02.450.4211.510.03DB24BM9369.106.70.930.222.040.02Marian is a mineralized ore body or “feeder zone” that trends in a northeast – southwest direction with a 67° dip to the southeast. It is located northwest of the Cieneguita Manto Zone, cutting carbonate rocks previously affected by calc-silicate metasomatism. The width of mineralization varies between 9 m and 26.4 m, with copper grades directly correlated to the presence of chalcopyrite, lesser bornite, and pyrite. Drill hole DB24BM958, at elevation of 1,200 m, is the deepest, and shows the potential of going additional 600 m at depth with the structure open laterally and vertically (Figure 2).Quality Assurance and Quality Control ProtocolsAll sampling was conducted under the supervision of the Company's geologists, adhering to industry best practices. Drill core samples were split on-site, with one half sent to ALS Chemex de México, a certified laboratory, for preparation and assay, while the other half was retained for reference purposes. Only the samples of DB24BM936 were sent to the Piedras Verdes laboratory at the mine. Sierra Metals implemented a rigorous QA/QC program, as outlined in Sections 10 and 11 of the Bolivar Technical Report, which is available for review on the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca).Qualified Persons StatementRicardo Salazar Milla (AIG #8551), Corporate Manager – Mineral Resources of Sierra, is a Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101.
