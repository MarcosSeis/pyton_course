        "content": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 13, 2025) -First Majestic Silver Corp.(NYSE: AG) (TSX: AG) (FSE: FMV) (the\"Company\"or \"First Majestic\") is pleased to announce the Company's consolidated 2025 production and cost guidance for the Company's four producing underground mines in Mexico, namely the Cerro Los Gatos Silver Mine (the Company holds a 70% interest in the Los Gatos Joint Venture that owns the mine), the Santa Elena Silver/Gold Mine, the San Dimas Silver/Gold Mine, and the La Encantada Silver Mine. The Company will be holding a conference call with management at 8:30 a.m. (PT) on Thursday, February 20, 2025, to discuss First Majestic's 2024 financial results and 2025 production and cost guidance.2025 PRODUCTION GUIDANCEIn 2025, the Company expects to achieve total attributable production from its four operating mines in Mexico of between 27.8 to 31.2 million silver equivalent (\"AgEq\") ounces, including 13.6 to 15.3 million ounces of silver. The increase in forecasted silver production compared to 2024 is due to the addition of attributable production from the Cerro Los Gatos Silver Mine as a result of the Company's acquisition of Gatos Silver, Inc. on January 16, 2025, as well as an increase in silver production from Santa Elena, and from La Encantada, following a return to normal operations at La Encantada in the fourth quarter of 2024.A mine-by-mine breakdown of the 2025 production guidance is included in the table below. The Company reports cost guidance to reflect cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\") on a per AgEq attributable payable ounce. The metal price and foreign currency assumptions that were used to calculate the numbers below were: silver: $29.00/oz, gold: $2,500/oz, lead: $0.95/lb., zinc: $1.25/lb. and MXN:USD 19.5:1.2025 Production GuidanceOperationSilver Oz(M)Gold Oz(k)Lead Lbs(M)Zinc Lbs(M)Silver Eqv.

The Company calculates cash costs and consolidated AISC in the manner set out in the table below. These measures have been calculated on a basis consistent with historical periods. For further details, see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" on pages 42 to 52 of the Company's most recently filed Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the third quarter of 2024, dated November 7, 2024, available on SEDAR+ atwww.sedarplus.caand on EDGAR atwww.sec.gov.The Company is projecting its consolidated 2025 AISC to be within a range of $19.89 to $21.27 on a per attributable payable AgEq ounce basis. Excluding non-cash items, the Company anticipates its 2025 AISC to be within a range of $19.35 to $20.67 per attributable payable AgEq ounce. An itemized AISC cost table is provided below.All-In Sustaining Cost CalculationFY 2025($ per AgEq oz)Total Cash Costs per Payable Equivalent Silver Ounce14.10 - 14.86General and Administrative Costs1.32 - 1.47Sustaining Development Costs0.94 - 1.00Sustaining Property, Plant and Equipment Costs1.75 - 1.96Profit Sharing0.70 - 0.78Lease Payments0.54 - 0.60Share-based Payments (non-cash)0.40 - 0.45Accretion and Reclamation Costs (non-cash)0.14 - 0.15All-In Sustaining Costs (AgEq Oz)19.89 - 21.27All-In Sustaining Costs: (AgEq Oz excluding non-cash items)19.35 - 20.67AISC is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated based on the Company's consolidated operating performance. Other mining companies may calculate AISC differently as a result of differences in: underlying accounting principles; the definition of \"sustaining costs\"; and the distinction between sustaining and expansionary capital costs. For further details, see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" on pages 42 to 52 of the Company's most recently filed MD&A for the third quarter of 2024, dated November 7, 2024, available on SEDAR+ atwww.sedarplus.caand on EDGAR atwww.sec.gov.Consolidated AISC includes general and administrative cost estimates and non-cash costs of $1.86 to $2.07 per AgEq ounce.CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN 2025In 2025, the Company plans to invest approximately $182 million in capital expenditures consisting of $80 million for sustaining activities and $102 million for expansionary projects. This represents a 34% increase compared to the revised 2024 capital expenditures guidance driven largely by the addition of the attributable capital expenditures of the Cerro Los Gatos Silver Mine and is aligned with the Company's future growth strategy underpinned by exploration and development activities at Santa Elena and San Dimas.Capital Guidance for 2025AreaSustaining ($M)Expansionary ($M)Total ($M)Underground Development$28$46$74Exploration-$49$49Property, Plant and Equipment$51$5$56Corporate Projects$1$2$3Total$80$102$182The 2025 annual guidance includes total capital investments of $74 million for underground development; $49 million in exploration; $56 million towards property, plant and equipment; and $3 million towards corporate innovation projects. Management may revise the guidance during the year to reflect actual and anticipated changes in metal prices or to the business. There can be no assurance that cost estimates related to the Company's 2025 guidance will prove to be accurate. For further details regarding risks related to the allocation of capital by the Company, see the section in the Company's most recently filed Annual Information Form (\"AIF\") entitled\"Risk Factors - Financial Risks - Allocation of Capital - Sustaining and Expansionary Capital\".The Company is planning approximately 270,000 metres (\"m\") of exploration drilling in 2025, representing a significant increase compared to the 182,932 m completed in 2024. The 2025 drilling program is expected to consist of:At San Dimas, approximately 112,000 m of drilling is planned with infill, step-out and exploratory holes focused on near mine and brownfield targets including major ore controlling structures in the West, Central and Sinaloa blocks. Exploration efforts represent a balanced approach to adding Inferred Resources along known veins, converting Inferred to Indicated Resources and identifying new veins in locations where post mineral cover has deferred work to date. Additionally, the exploration team anticipates returning to the Tayoltita and Santa Rita areas where little to no exploration has taken place in recent years.At Santa Elena, approximately 57,000 m of drilling is planned. Greenfield and brownfield drilling at Santa Elena will focus on several targets within a 5-kilometre radius around the processing plant where new geologic understanding of district stratigraphy has brought to light large areas with exploration upside. First Majestic will continue to drill the Navidad project where both extension and infill drilling are planned.At Cerro Los Gatos, approximately 76,000 m of drilling is planned. Exploration will be focused on testing potential areas for mineralization expansion at the Central Deep and South East targets as well as taking a first step at exploring the wider land package in search of new ore bodies.At Jerritt Canyon, approximately 18,000 m of drilling is planned. Exploration work will be focused on testing the extension of known ore controlling structures below outcropping Upper Plate (cover rock) where the presence of large, mineralized volumes is possible and has been poorly tested to date.The Company plans to complete approximately 35,500 metres of underground development in 2025, compared to 32,047 m completed in 2024. The 2025 development program consists of approximately 14,000 m at San Dimas, 8,100 m at Santa Elena, 7,800 m at Cerro Los Gatos, and 5,600 m at La Encantada. At San Dimas, the Company is planning to concentrate development metres in the Perez, Regina and Elia Veins. At the Santa Elena district, underground development is expected to focus on Ermita√±o and the advancement of the Luna ramp. At the Cerro Los Gatos district, development is to take place in all segments (NW, Central and SE) of the mine. At La Encantada, the Company plans to develop the Ojuelas and Milagros ore bodies for 2025 production.CONFERENCE CALL DETAILSThe Company will host a conference call and webcast onThursday, February 20, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. (PT) / 11:30 a.m. (ET)to provide investors and analysts with a business update, and to discuss its 2024 earnings and production results and 2025 guidance.To participate in the conference call, please use the following dial-in numbers:Canada & USA Toll-Free:1-844-763-8274Outside of Canada & USA:+1-647-484-8814Toll-Free Germany:+49-69-17415718Toll-Free UK:+44-20-3795-9972Participants should dial-in at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the call to ensure placement in the conference on time.A live webcast of the call will be accessible through the \"February 20, 2025 Webcast Link\" on the First Majestic home page atwww.firstmajestic.com.

The program, which is targeting the highly prospective Promontorio vein zone, continues to demonstrate robust silver mineralization, with exceptional intercepts including:3.00 m of 4,173 g/t silver equivalent (\"AgEq\")(AL24-111);6.35 m of 380 g/t AgEq(AL24-110); and5.75 m of 189 g/t AgEq.(AL24-112) (Table 1) (Figures 1, 2, 3).\"These results, which underscore the significant potential of the Alamos project, highlight the consistent high-grade silver mineralization drilled over impressive widths along the 1 km strike length of the Promontorio vein zone,\"stated Darrell Rader, President and CEO of Minaurum Gold,\"Now that considerable assay lab delays have been resolved, we look forward to releasing additional results from Promontorio, including the Tirito area, which returned the headline silver intercept.\"Promontorio Vein ZonePromontorio, along with the Europa vein zone, is one of the high-priority targets in which the Company will establish a maiden resource at the Alamos silver project. The 1 km-long Promontorio vein zone consists of multiple veins including the Veta Grande, Veta del 100, and Veta Las Guijas (see Minaurum news release dated February 6, 2020).Minaurum's drilling is focused on establishing 75- to 100-m spacings between vein intersections, as well as step-out drilling. Assays for the first 5 holes of the campaign were announced on September 19, 2024. These included several high-grade intercepts including:0.70 m of 2,976 g/t AgEq(AL24-105);5.60 m of 368 g/t AgEqand2.55 m of 621 g/t AgEq(AL24-107); and8.45 m of 336 g/t AgEq(AL24-108).The four holes reported in this news release further demonstrate the high-grade continuity of the prior drill holes. Holes AL24-110 and -111 were drilled on a fence in the Tirito area of the of Las Guijas vein, while AL24-112 and -113 were drilled on another fence in the northern part of the Veta Grande (Figures 1 and 2). In the Tirito area, the Las Guijas zone contains two separate and discrete veins. Hole AL24-111 intersected a significant high-grade sub interval returning1.55 m of 7,780 AgEq,which includes0.50 m of 13,995 g/t AgEqand1.05 m of 4,839 g/t AgEq.Mineralized core is shown in Figure 3.

Maynard, Vice President of Exploration of Minaurum and a Qualified Person (QP) as defined by National Instrument 43-101, reviewed and verified the assay data, and has approved the disclosure in this News Release. Verification was done by visual inspection of core samples and comparison to assay results. Assay results have not been checked by re-analysis. No factors were identified that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data presented in this news release.Analytical Procedures and Quality Assurance/Quality ControlPreparation and assaying of drilling samples from Minaurum's Alamos project are done with strict adherence to a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) protocol. Core samples from the 2024 program are sawed in half and then bagged in a secure facility near the site, and then shipped by a licensed courier to ActLabs preparation facility in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, Mexico. ActLabs prepares the samples, crushing them to 70% less than 2mm, splitting off 250g, and pulverizing the split to more than 85% passing 75 microns. The resulting sample pulps are prepared in Zacatecas, and then shipped to Vancouver for chemical analysis by ActLabs. The pulps are analyzed for gold by fire assay and ICP/AES on a 50-gram charge. In addition, analyses are done for a 48-element suite using 4-acid digestion and ICP analysis. Samples with silver values greater than 100 g/t; and copper, lead, or zinc values greater than 10,000 ppm (1%) are re-analyzed using 4-acid digestion and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).Quality-control (QC) samples are inserted in the sample stream every 20 samples, and thus represent 5% of the total samples. QC samples include standards, blanks, and duplicate samples. Standards are pulps that have been prepared by a third-party laboratory; they have gold, silver, and base-metal values that are established by an extensive analytical process in which several commercial labs (including ActLabs) participate. Standards test the calibration of the analytical equipment. Blanks are rock material known from prior sampling to contain less than 0.005 ppm gold; they test the sample preparation procedure for cross-sample contamination. In the case of duplicates, the sample interval is cut in half, and then quartered. The first quarter is the original sample, the second becomes the duplicate. Duplicate samples provide a test of the reproducibility of assays in the same drilled interval.When final assays are received, QC sample results are inspected for deviation from accepted values by the QP. To date, QC sample analytical results have fallen in acceptable ranges on the Alamos project.ActLabs is independent of Minaurum Gold and is independent of the Qualified Person.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking InformationThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. \"Forward-looking information\" includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to activities, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future.

The updated resistivity and IP profiles provide enhanced visualization, crucial for characterizing the deposit anomalies and supporting further drilling of untested high-profile copper targets within the project area. The geophysical compilation work was executed by the experienced Fabr√≠cio Santos, MSc. In Geophysics.HIGHLIGHTSIdentification of deep shear zones in IP and Resistivity sections, acting as possible channels for sulphide-rich mineralizing fluids as the source of the copper mineralization at the 4H Copper Project. Geoelectrical Line 1 shows the continuity of a possible shear zone to the east (Figure 3).Evidence of mineralization associated with sulphides in IP anomalies, indicating potential for copper concentration in the shear structures at depth.Drillholes close to the anomalies in the West Zone indicates that copper is grading into the direction of these structures, suggesting these drillholes may be proximal to these untested zones.The 4H Copper Project is in Sonora, Mexico, and comprises nine concessions totalling 2,825 hectares and contains a large porphyry copper-molybdenum system with surface measurements of at least four kilometres east-west by two kilometres north-south. The Company released a recent NI43-101 report on the 4H Project in October 2023.Primary sulphide mineralisation is chalcopyrite and molybdenite with secondary oxide chalcocite.The 4H Copper Project (Figure 1) has 123 drill holes. 70 holes with associated geochemical analyses for copper and molybdenum were identified. Thus, 70 strip logs were created with geochemical data for these two elements when available. Some holes had their samples composited.Figure 1Location of the project and drillholes.Figure 2shows a block model with the topography and IP sections positioned along the study area to evaluate the positions of the geophysical anomalies and their association with the known areas of copper mineralization.Figure 2Study area block Model and IP sections.The geoelectric response over Line 1 indicates the presence of a structure similar to a shear zone in the west-east direction. The structure intersects the Main Zone (the basis of the current resource at the 4H Copper Project) in the subsurface and suggests continuity of the shear zone to the east. An evaluation of the copper content (%) of Drill Hole CHDD04-08 indicates increased values over the structure.InFigure 3below, which integrates the IP section with the position of hole CHDD04-08 and the copper concentration profile (%), is shown in detail. The association of this information shows the existence of the interpreted shear zone, where possible circulation of metal-rich fluids along this zone may occur.Figure 3IP Section Line 1 and associated drillhole CHDD04-08.The IP/resistivity section of lines 2 and 4 inFigure 4below, show where structures similar to deep shear zones are observed. Deep shear zones are highly significant in copper exploration, especially in hydrothermal systems. These zones can act as conduits for the circulation of metal-rich fluids and facilitate the transport and deposition of copper and other sulphides. In the IP sections, the presence of high IP associated with these deep shear zones may indicate concentrations of sulphide minerals. These anomalies suggest that the shear zones played not only a structural but also a mineralizing role, allowing copper to be deposited along these fractures and possibly in adjacent zones.Drill Holes in the West Zone are close to the anomaly and with indication of possible increases in copper grades in the direction of the anomaly. However, no drill hole has intercepted these anomalies to date.The integrated result suggests that future drilling should focus on these higher potential zones, aiming to confirm and delineate the extension and grade of copper and molybdenum along these structures.Figure 4Study area IP/resistivity section lines 2 and 4.Further to the News Release of November 20, 2024, the company will modify the terms of the non-brokered private placement financing for aggregate gross proceeds of up to $750,000.
